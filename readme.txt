Rules for word types

1. Non-meaningful orthographic variation should be resolved.

a. Sentence-initial (non-meaningful) capitalisation should be resolved to lowercase. However, initial uppercase should be retained in names eg. a’ Gàidhealtachd, Rob, Aonghas a’ Bhàillidh, anns a’ Bhìoball.

2. Apostrophes representing ellipsis should be resolved, eg. ’s = is | is^agus, b’ = bu, bh’ = bha, th’ = tha, a’m = agam. But apostrophes are retained in mutation forms like dh’èirich. Note the following cases involved an elides (or hidden) third person masculine possessive determiner – ’athair (athair) = a_athair. The same goes for elided or hidden inversion articles – fhagail = a_fhàgail.
