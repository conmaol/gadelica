### Modifiers of nouns

A noun can have one or more modifiers, all of which must follow the noun. There are four kinds of word that can be used to modify a noun – **adjectives**, **genitive nouns**, **prepositions**, or **relative clause particles**.

#### Adjectives as modifiers of nouns

A noun can have one or more adjective modifiers.

*Proper nouns* can be modified by adjectives.

> Phòs a mhàthair rìgh àraidh an déidh sin, ach cha do leig i <mark title="The nominative masculine proper noun ‘Fionn’ [Finn] is modified by the adjective ‘beag’ [little] – ‘Little Finn’.">Fionn beag</mark> as a h-aire.

Note that unless otherwise specified all examples are taken from the same text as was analysed in previous sections.

In the above example, the nominative masculine proper noun ***Fionn*** ‘Finn’ is modified by the adjective ***beag*** ‘little’ – ***Fionn beag*** ‘little Finn’.

*Common nouns* can be modified by adjectives too.

> Nuair a bha an saoghal òg bha <mark title="The nominative plural common noun ‘daoine’ [men] is modified by the adjective ‘treuna’ [strong] – ‘strong men’.">daoine treuna</mark> ann, ris an canadh iad an Fhiann.
> 
> Nuair a bha Fionn ’na <mark title="The dative masculine common noun ‘leanabh’ [an infant] is modified by the adjective ‘beag’ [little] – ‘a little infant’.">leanabh beag</mark>, mharbhadh ’athair ann an aon de na blàraibh a chuir an Fhiann ’nam measg fhéin.
> 
> Sheinn i <mark title="The nominative masculine common noun ‘crònan’ [tune] is modified by the adjectives ‘milis’ [sweet] and ‘binn’ [melodious] – ‘sweet melodious tune’.">crònan milis binn</mark> dha, agus an sin thog i oirre.

In the first of these examples, the nominative plural common noun ***daoine*** ‘men’ is modified by the adjective ***treuna*** ‘strong’ – ***daoine treuna*** ‘strong men’. In the second, the dative masculine common noun ***leanabh*** ‘an infant’ is modified by the adjective ***beag*** ‘little’ – ***leanabh beag*** ‘a little infant’. 

In the third example, the nominative masculine common noun ***crònan*** ‘tune’ has not one but *two* adjective modifiers, ***milis*** ‘sweet’ and ***binn*** ‘melodious’ – ***crònan milis binn*** ‘a sweet melodious tune’. 

#### Genitive nouns as modifiers of other nouns

A noun can have a genitive noun modifier.

*Common nouns* can be modified by *non-plural* (feminine or masculine) genitive nouns.

> Fhuair i e ’na <mark title="The dative feminine common noun ‘shuain’ [slumber] is modified by the masculine genitive noun ‘chadail’ [sleep] – ‘slumber of sleep, sleepy slumber’.">shuain chadail</mark>, agus thog i e ’na làmhan gu sèimh socrach, agus phòg i e.

In this example, the dative feminine common noun ***shuain*** ‘slumber’ is modified by the masculine genitive noun ***chadail*** ‘sleep’ – ***shuain chadail*** ‘slumber of sleep, sleepy slumber’.

Common nouns can also be modified by *plural* genitive nouns.

> Bha an <mark title="The nominative feminine common noun ‘dithis’ [group of two people] is modified by the plural genitive noun ‘mhnathan’ [women] – ‘group of two women’.">dithis bhan</mark> ud a’ toirt an aire air gus an d’ fhàs e suas.

The nominative feminine common noun ***dithis*** ‘a group of two people’ is modified by the plural genitive noun ***bhan*** ‘women’ – ***dithis bhan*** ‘a group of two women’.

It is not clear whether *proper nouns* can also be modified by genitive nouns, since there are no examples in the current text being analysed.

#### Prepositions as modifiers of nouns

A noun can have one or more prepositions as modifiers.

*Common nouns* can be modified by prepositions (which themselves take other nouns as their complements).

> B’ e Cumhal a b’ <mark title="The nominative masculine common noun ‘ainm’ [name] is modified by the preposition ‘air’ [on] – ‘the name on/of one of these men’.">ainm air</mark> aon de na daoine seo, agus bha mac aige air an robh Fionn.
>
> Dh’fhalbh i <mark title="The nominative masculine common noun ‘astar’ [distance] is modified by the preposition ‘tro’ [through] – ‘long distance through desolate land’.">astar</mark> fada <mark>tro</mark> thìr fhàsail gus an do lorg i an t-àite anns an robh an leanabh.
>
> Rachadh e a-mach don achadh far an robh <mark title="The nominative plural common noun ‘gearrain’ [hares] is modified by the preposition ‘gu’ [to] – ‘hares to sufficiency, enough hares’.">gearrain gu</mark> leòr a’ ruith bho chnoc gu cnoc.

In the first example, the nominative masculine common noun ***ainm*** ‘name’ is modified by the preposition ***air*** ‘on’ (which itself has the complement *aon* ‘one’) – ***ainm air aon de na daoine seo*** ‘a name on (of) one of these men’. In the second, the common noun ***astar*** ‘distance’ is modified by the preposition ***tro*** ‘through’ – ***astar fada tro thìr fhàsail*** ‘a long distance through desolate land’.

In the third example, the nominative plural common noun ***gearrain*** ‘hares’ is modified by the preposition ***gu*** ‘to’ (which itself has the complement *leòr* ‘sufficiency’) – ***gearrain gu leòr*** ‘hares to sufficiency, enough hares’.

Prepositional pronouns can be modifiers of nouns all on their own.

> Thilg e urchair oirre, agus gheàrr sin na <mark title="The nominative plural common noun ‘sgiathan’ [wing] is modified by the prepositional pronoun ‘aice’ [at her] – ‘wings at her, her wings’.">sgiathan aice</mark>.

Here, the nominative plural common noun ***sgiathan*** ‘wings’ is modified by the prepositional pronoun ***aice*** ‘at her’ – ***sgiathan aice*** ‘wings at her, her wings’.

Also, the progressive particle ***ag*** counts as a preposition in this respect.

> Latha de na làithean chaidh e mach agus chunnaic e <mark title="The nominative feminine common noun ‘lach’ [duck] is modified by the particle ‘ag’ – ‘duck swimming on a lake’.">lach a’</mark> snàmh air loch.

In this examples, the nominative feminine common noun ***lach*** ‘duck’ is modified by the particle ***a’*** (which itself takes the verbal noun *snàmh* ‘swimming’ as its complement) – ***lach a’ snàmh*** ‘a duck swimming’.

It is not clear whether *proper nouns* can also be modified by prepositions, since there are no examples in the current text being analysed.

- Strictly speaking, it is the preposition itself which is the grammatical modifier of the noun in these examples, and not the whole prepositional phrase. Grammatical relations, as we understand them, are between individual words and not between words and phrases.

#### Relative clause particles as modifiers of nouns

A noun can have a relative clause particle as a modifier.

*Common nouns* can be modified by the positive particle ***a*** ‘who(m), which, that’.

> Nuair a bha Fionn ’na leanabh beag, mharbhadh ’athair ann an aon de na <mark title="The dative plural common noun ‘blàraibh’ [battles] is modified by the relative particle ‘a’ [which] – ‘the battles which sent the Fianna among themselves’.">blàraibh a</mark> chuir an Fhiann ’nam measg fhéin.
> 
> Is i siud a’ chiad <mark title="The nominative feminine common noun ‘shealg’ [hunt] is modified by the relative particle ‘a’ [which] – ‘the first hunt which Finn did’.">shealg a</mark> rinn Fionn.

In the first example, the dative plural common noun ***blàraibh*** ‘battles’ is modified by the positive relative clause particle ***a*** ‘which, that’ (which itself has the verb *chuir* as complement) – ***blàraibh a chuir an Fhiann ’nam measg fhéin*** ‘battles which sent the Fianna among themselves’.

In the second example, The nominative feminine common noun ***shealg*** ‘hunt’ is also modified by ***a*** (which takes the verb ***rinn*** ‘did’ as its own complement) – ***shealg a rinn Fionn*** ‘hunt which Finn did’.

Common nouns can also be modified by prepositional relative clause particles.

> Nuair a bha an saoghal òg bha <mark title="The nominative plural common noun ‘daoine’ [men] is modfied by the prepositional relative particle ‘ris (an)’ [to whom] – ‘strong men to whom they would say the Fianna (ie. whom they would call the Fianna)’.">daoine</mark> treuna ann, <mark>ris</mark> an canadh iad an Fhiann</mark>.
>
> Dh’fhalbh i astar fada troimh thìr fhàsail gus an do lorg i an <mark title="The nominative masculine common noun ‘t-àite’ [place] is modified by the prepositional relative particle ‘anns an’ [in which] – ‘the place in which the infant was’." >t-àite anns</mark> an robh an leanabh.

In the first example here, the nominative plural common noun ***daoine*** ‘men’ is modified by the prepositional relative clause particle ***ris*** ‘against whom’ (which takes as complement the positive interrogative verb particle *an*, which itself takes as complement the verb *canadh* ‘would say’) – ***daoine ris an canadh iad an Fhiann*** ‘men against whom they would say the Fianna (ie. men whom they would call the Fianna)’.

In the second example, the nominative masculine common noun ***t-àite*** ‘place’ is modified by the prepositional relative clause particle ***anns*** ‘in which’ (which also takes as complement the positive interrogative verb particle *an*, which itself takes as complement the verb *robh* ‘was’) – ***àite anns an robh an leanabh*** ‘place in which the infant was’.

Common nouns can also be modified by the locative relative clause particle ***far***.

> Rachadh e a-mach don <mark title="The dative masculine common noun ‘achadh’ [field] is modified by the relative particle ‘far an’ [where] – ‘the place where plenty of hares were running from hill to hill’.">achadh far</mark> an robh gearrain gu leòr a’ ruith bho chnoc gu cnoc.

In this example, the dative masculine common noun ***achadh*** ‘a field’ is modified by the locative relative clause particle ***far*** ‘where’ (which takes as its complement the positive interrogative verb particle *an*, which itself takes the verb *robh* ‘was’ as its complement) – ***achadh far an robh gearrain a’ ruith*** ‘field where hares were running’.

It is not clear whether *proper nouns* can also be modified by relative clause particles, since there are no examples in the current text being analysed.
