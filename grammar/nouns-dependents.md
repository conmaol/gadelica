## Dependents of nouns

A noun can have zero or more dependents, for example modifiers, specifiers, complements, and other nouns standing in apposition.

### Bare nouns

If a noun has no dependents of any kind, it is known as a ‘bare’ noun.

*Proper nouns* usually occur bare.

> B’ e <mark title="The nominative masculine proper noun ‘Cumhal’ has no dependents here (though it is itself a dependent of the copula verb ‘bu’ [was]).">Cumhal</mark> a b’ ainm air aon de na daoine seo, agus bha mac aige air an robh <mark title="The nominative masculine proper ‘Fionn’ [Finn] has no dependents here (though it is itself the subject of the verb ‘robh’ [was]).">Fionn</mark>.
>
> Is i siud a’ chiad shealg a rinn <mark title="The nominative masculine proper ‘Fionn’ [Finn] has no dependents here (though it is itself the subject of the verb ‘rinn’ [did]).">Fionn</mark>.

Note that unless otherwise specified all examples are taken from the same text as was analysed in previous sections.

In these two examples, the nominative masculine proper nouns ***Cumhal*** and both instances of ***Fionn*** are both bare of dependents, even though they are all dependents (specifically subjects) of verbs, respectively ***b’*** (*bu*), ***robh*** and ***rinn***. 

*Common nouns* can also appear bare, in which case they have ‘indefinite’, unmodified meaning.

> Latha de na làithean chaidh e a-mach agus chunnaic e lach a’ snàmh air <mark title="The dative masculine common noun ‘loch’ [lake] has no dependents here (though it is itself the complement of the preposition ‘air’ [on]).">loch</mark>.
>
> Thilg e <mark title="The nominative feminine common noun ‘urchair’ [shot, stone] has no dependents here (though it is itself the object of the verb ‘thilg’ [threw]).">urchair</mark> oirre, agus gheàrr sin na sgiathan aice.
> 
> Bha aige ri an cumail ’nan cròileagan cruinn ann am badan àraidh, agus is ann le bhith sìor ruith timcheall orra a bha a chasan mu dheireadh cho luath ri casan <mark title="The genitive masculine common noun ‘féidh’ [deer] has no dependents here (though it is itself the specifier of the noun ‘casan’ [feet]).">féidh</mark>.

All three of the common nouns highlighted here lack any dependents, although they are all dependents of other words in the sentence. The dative masculine noun ***loch*** ‘a lake’ is the complement of the preposition ***air*** ‘on’; the nominative feminine noun ***urchair*** ‘a shot, a stone’ is the object of the verb ***thilg*** ‘threw’; and the genitive masculine noun ***féidh*** ‘a deer’ is the specifier of the plural common noun ***casan*** ‘feet’.
