## Concrete nouns and abstract nouns

Nouns are words that typically denote *material* entities.

Material entities are those real-world individuals, substances, aggregates and groups which are literally *made of matter* – atoms organised into molecules and crystals etc. 

Every word that denotes a material entity is a noun (or a [pronoun](pronouns.md)). 

However, not every noun denotes a material entity. Some nouns denote *non-material* entities, which are not made out of matter. Non-material entities include spaces (places and paths) and situations (states, processes, events and actions).

Nouns that denote material entities are known as *concrete* nouns, and nouns that denote non-material entities are known as *abstract* nouns. 

The following passage is adapted from the story *[Fionn](Fionn.md)* in Lachlann MacFhionghuin’s (c.1950) *Leabhraichean Leughaidh: Leabhar II* (p.81). All and only the nouns have been highlighted.

> Nuair a bha an **saoghal** òg bha **daoine** treuna ann, ris an canadh iad an **Fhiann**.
>
> B’ e **Cumhal** a b’ **ainm** air aon de na **daoine** seo, agus bha **mac** aige air an robh **Fionn**.
>
> Nuair a bha **Fionn** ’na **leanabh** beag, mharbhadh ’**athair** ann an aon de na **blàraibh** a chuir an **Fhiann** ’nam **measg** fhéin.
>
> Bha **eagal** air a **mhàthair** gun tigeadh **naimhdean** ’**athar** air **tòir** an **leinibh**, agus mar sin chuir i e a-mach do na **coilltean** fàsail air **chùram** **dithis** **bhan** eòlach. 

The concrete nouns in this passage are
`saoghal` ‘a world’,
`daoine` ‘men’,
`Fhiann` ‘warriors’,
`Cumhall` ‘Cumhall’,
`mac` ‘a son’,
`Fionn` ‘Finn’,
`leanabh` / `leinibh` ‘an infant’,
`athair` / `athar` ‘a father’,
`mhàthair` ‘a mother’,
`naimhdean` ‘enemies’,
`coilltean` ‘forests’,
`dithis` ‘a group of two people’ and
`bhan` ‘women’.

The abstract nouns in the passage are 
`ainm` ‘a name’,
`blàraibh` ‘battles’,
`measg` ‘midst’,
`eagal` ‘fear’,
`tòir` ‘a pursuit’ and
`chùram` ‘care’.

Notes:

- Some readers might be uncomfortable seeing words like `measg`, `tòir` and perhaps even `chùram` classified as (abstract) nouns here, preferring to think of them as being parts of (complex) *prepositions* rather than words in and of themselves. However, this is a false binary – `measg`, `tòir` and `chùram` are, at one and the same time, both components of (lexicalised) prepositional compounds *and* (perhaps fossilised) nouns.
  
- The (concrete) noun `dithis` ‘a group of two people’ is most accurately classified as a (concrete) noun with numeric meaning, rather than as a numeral *per se*.

- Nouns have been defined in broadly similar terms by other grammarians of Gaelic:
  > Nouns are a time-stable class denoting entities, places and objects, as well as concepts that have similar grammatical behaviour. Examples of nouns are *ubhal* ‘apple’, *nighean* ‘girl’, *clann* ‘children’, *beachd* ‘opinion’, *astar* ‘distance’, *Dòmhnall* ‘Donald’ and *Glaschu* ‘Glasgow’. (Lamb 2024: 37)
  > 
  > Tha ainmear ’na ainm air duine no air nì, m.e. *boireannach*; *balach*; *bòrd*; *doras*. (Cox 2017: §55)
  >
  > Ainmear eas-cruthach, a tha ’na ainm air rudeigin nach cluinn, nach fhaic, agus ris nach bean duine, m.e. *an fhìrinn*; *an t-slàinte*; *am bàs*; *a’ bheatha*; *a’ chogais* 7c – seach *bòrd*; *doras* 7c a tha ’na ainmearan cruthach. (Cox 2017: §56(v))

## Proper nouns and common nouns

Alongside the distinction between concrete and abstract nouns, nouns can be further sub-classified according to the nature of their denotation, or the way in which they relate to entities in the world.

*Proper nouns* are names of particular entities

*Common nouns* denote classes of entity

In the [Fionn](Fionn.md) passage from the previous section, there are two proper nouns – `Cumhal` ‘Cumhall’ and `Fionn` ‘Finn’. 

All the other nouns in the passage, whether concrete or abstract, are common nouns – 
`saoghal` ‘a world’,
`daoine` ‘men’,
`Fhiann` ‘warriors’,
`ainm` ‘a name’,
`mac` ‘a son’,
`leanabh` / `leinibh` ‘an infant’,
`athair` / `athar` ‘a father’,
`blàraibh` ‘battles’,
`measg` ‘midst’,
`eagal` ‘fear’,
`mhàthair` ‘a mother’,
`naimhdean` ‘enemies’,
`tòir` ‘a pursuit’,
`coilltean` ‘forests’,
`chùram` ‘care’,
`dithis` ‘a group of two people’ and
`bhan` ‘women’.

Notes:

- Proper nouns are always capitalised in writing, even when they do not occur as the first word in a sentence. However, not all capitalised nouns in the middle of a sentence are proper nouns. For example, `Fhiann` ‘warriors’ in the passage above is correctly classified as a common noun. It is capitalised in the text because it is the core element (the ‘head’) of a phrase, `an Fhiann` ‘the Warriors’, which is being presented as the name of a particular group of men (cf. ‘the Fenians’). Moreover, even though `an Fhiann` is a name, it would be incorrect to characterise it as a proper noun, since it is not a noun.
  
- The dimensions of concrete vs. abstract and proper vs. common are not truly orthogonal. It seems that all proper nouns are concrete, and hence that all abstract nouns are common.

- The distinction between proper and common nouns is familiar from the work of other grammarians of Gaelic (even if they typically confuse proper nouns with names in general):
  
  >  Gaelic has two broad noun categories: common nouns and proper nouns. Common nouns are the physical and abstract entities that we discuss regularly in language, such as ‘bird’, ‘mountain’ or ‘philosophy’. Proper nouns are those items that we normally capitalise in writing, such as persons (‘Donald’) and places (‘Cape Breton’).” (Lamb 2024: 46)
  > 
  > Tha diofar sheòrsaichean ainmearan ann: (i) Ainmear cumanta, a tha na ainm air rudeigin bitheanta, m.e. *boireannach*; *cat*; *bròg*; *sùil*; *aran*; *taigh*. (ii) Ainmear sònraichte, a tha na ainm air duine, air àite no air rudeigin àraidh, m.e. *Mòrag*; *Seumas*; *Glaschu*; *BBC ALBA*; *an Gearasdan*. (iii) [...] (Cox 2017: §56)
  >
  > *noun*: the name of a thing or concept (e.g. “train”, “beauty”) or of a person or place (i.e. proper nouns, e.g. “Dr Who”, “Italy”). (Byrne 2002: 15)
  
- Note that Cox (2017: §56) lists five other classes of noun in addition to (and seemingly independent of) common and proper nouns: collective nouns (*ainmear trusaidh* eg. `clann`, `crodh`); quantity nouns (*ainmear meud* eg. `falt`, `bainne`); abstract nouns (*ainmear eas-cruthach* – see above); compound nouns (*ainmear fillte* eg. `taigh-beag`, `cailleach-dhubh`); and verbal nouns (*ainmear gnìomhaireach* eg. `dèanamh`, `ithe`). For present purposes, and with the obvious exception of his ‘compound nouns’ (many of which are not even nouns at all), these are best understood as semantic sub-classes of common noun.
