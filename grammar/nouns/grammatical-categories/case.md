# Nominative nouns, dative nouns and genitive nouns

Nouns in Gaelic have *case* – every noun is either *nominative* or *dative* or *genitive*.

Consider the following passage:

> `Nuair a bha an saoghal òg bha daoine treuna ann, ris an canadh iad an Fhiann.`  
> ‘When the world was young there were brave men, who were called the Fenians.’
>
> `B’ e Cumhal a b’ ainm air aon de na daoine seo, agus bha mac aige air an robh Fionn.`  
> ‘Cumhal was the name of one of these men, and he had a son who was called Finn.’
>
> `Nuair a bha Fionn ’na leanabh beag, mharbhadh ’athair ann an aon de na blàraibh a chuir an Fhiann ’nam measg fhéin.`  
> ‘When Finn was a little infant, his father was killed in one of the battles that sent the Fenians amongst each other.’
>
> `Bha eagal air a mhàthair gun tigeadh naimhdean ’athar air tòir an leinibh.`  
> ‘His mother was afraid that his father’s enemies would come in pursuit of the infant.’
>
> `Mar sin chuir i e a-mach do na coilltean fàsail air chùram dithis bhan eòlach.`  
> ‘Therefore she sent him out to the desolate forests in the care of two wise women.’ 

The dative nouns in this passage are: 
- `daoine` ‘men’ (second sentence)
- `leanabh` ‘an infant’
- `blàraibh` ‘battles’
- `measg` ‘midst’
- `mhàthair` ‘a mother’
- `tòir` ‘a pursuit’
- `coilltean` ‘forests’
- `chùram` ‘care’

The genitive nouns are: 
- `athar` ‘a father’
- `leinibh` ‘an infant’
- `dithis` ‘a group of two people’
- `bhan` ‘women’

All the other nouns in the passage are nominative nouns: 
- `saoghal` ‘a world’
- `daoine` ‘men’ (first sentence)
- `Fhiann` ‘warriors’ (both occurences)
- `Cumhal`
- `ainm` ‘a name’
- `mac` ‘a son’
- `Fionn` ‘Finn’ (both occurences)
- `athair` ‘a father’
- `eagal` ‘fear’
- `naimhdean` ‘enemies’

Notes:

- Unless otherwise specified, examples are adapted from the story *[Fionn](../../texts/Fionn.md)*, in Lachlann MacFhionghuin’s (c.1950) *Leabhraichean Leughaidh: Leabhar II* (pp. 81–85).

- Traditional descriptions of Gaelic grammar commonly mention the ‘vocative’ as a fourth case. However, the vocative is not strictly speaking a grammatical case since it does not mark a syntactic relation between the noun and another verb, preposition, adjective or noun in the same sentence. For this reason, we will treat the vocative as a handful of inflectional idiosyncracies conditioned by the vocative particle `a`.

- Case is fully orthogonal to the other noun categories discussed thus far – proper vs. common nouns, and feminine vs. masculine vs. plural nouns.

- Some other definitions of case:
  
  > Faodaidh ainmearan a bhith [...] bunasach, ginideach, tabhartach no gairmeach. (Cox 2017: §55)
