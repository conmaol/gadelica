# Proper nouns and common nouns

Nouns can be classified according to the nature of their denotation, or the way in which they relate to entities in the world.

*Proper nouns* are names of particular entities.

*Common nouns* denote classes of entity.

Consider the following passage:

> `Nuair a bha an saoghal òg bha daoine treuna ann, ris an canadh iad an Fhiann.`  
> ‘When the world was young there were brave men, who were called the Fenians.’
>
> `B’ e Cumhal a b’ ainm air aon de na daoine seo, agus bha mac aige air an robh Fionn.`  
> ‘Cumhal was the name of one of these men, and he had a son who was called Finn.’
>
> `Nuair a bha Fionn ’na leanabh beag, mharbhadh ’athair ann an aon de na blàraibh a chuir an Fhiann ’nam measg fhéin.`  
> ‘When Finn was a little infant, his father was killed in one of the battles that sent the Fenians amongst each other.’
>
> `Bha eagal air a mhàthair gun tigeadh naimhdean ’athar air tòir an leinibh.`  
> ‘His mother was afraid that his father’s enemies would come in pursuit of the infant.’
>
> `Mar sin chuir i e a-mach do na coilltean fàsail air chùram dithis bhan eòlach.`  
> ‘Therefore she sent him out to the desolate forests in the care of two wise women.’

There are two proper nouns in this passage – `Cumhal` ‘Cumhal’ and `Fionn` ‘Finn’. 

All the other nouns in the passage, whether concrete or abstract, are common nouns:
- `saoghal` ‘a world’
- `daoine` ‘men’
- `Fhiann` ‘warriors’
- `ainm` ‘a name’
- `mac` ‘a son’
- `leanabh` / `leinibh` ‘an infant’
- `athair` / `athar` ‘a father’
- `blàraibh` ‘battles’
- `measg` ‘midst’
- `eagal` ‘fear’
- `mhàthair` ‘a mother’
- `naimhdean` ‘enemies’
- `tòir` ‘a pursuit’
- `coilltean` ‘forests’
- `chùram` ‘care’
- `dithis` ‘a group of two people’
- `bhan` ‘women’

Notes:

- Unless otherwise specified, examples are adapted from the story *[Fionn](../../texts/Fionn.md)*, in Lachlann MacFhionghuin’s (c.1950) *Leabhraichean Leughaidh: Leabhar II* (pp. 81–85).

- Proper nouns are always capitalised in writing, even when they do not occur as the first word in a sentence. However, not all capitalised nouns in the middle of a sentence are proper nouns. For example, `Fhiann` ‘warriors’ in the passage above is correctly classified as a common noun. It is capitalised in the text because it is the core element (the ‘head’) of a phrase, `an Fhiann` ‘the Warriors’, which is being presented as the name of a particular group of men (cf. ‘the Fenians’). Moreover, even though `an Fhiann` is a name, it would be incorrect to characterise it as a proper noun, since it is not a noun.
  
- The dimensions of concrete vs. abstract and proper vs. common are not truly orthogonal. It seems that all proper nouns are concrete, and hence that all abstract nouns are common.

- The distinction between proper and common nouns is familiar from the work of other grammarians of Gaelic (even if they typically confuse proper nouns with names in general):
  
  >  Gaelic has two broad noun categories: common nouns and proper nouns. Common nouns are the physical and abstract entities that we discuss regularly in language, such as ‘bird’, ‘mountain’ or ‘philosophy’. Proper nouns are those items that we normally capitalise in writing, such as persons (‘Donald’) and places (‘Cape Breton’).” (Lamb 2024: 46)

  > Tha diofar sheòrsaichean ainmearan ann: (i) Ainmear cumanta, a tha na ainm air rudeigin bitheanta, m.e. *boireannach*; *cat*; *bròg*; *sùil*; *aran*; *taigh*. (ii) Ainmear sònraichte, a tha na ainm air duine, air àite no air rudeigin àraidh, m.e. *Mòrag*; *Seumas*; *Glaschu*; *BBC ALBA*; *an Gearasdan*. (iii) [...] (Cox 2017: §56)
  >
  > *noun*: the name of a thing or concept (e.g. “train”, “beauty”) or of a person or place (i.e. proper nouns, e.g. “Dr Who”, “Italy”). (Byrne 2002: 15)
  
- Note that Cox (2017: §56) lists five other classes of noun in addition to (and seemingly independent of) common and proper nouns: collective nouns (*ainmear trusaidh* eg. `clann`, `crodh`); quantity nouns (*ainmear meud* eg. `falt`, `bainne`); abstract nouns (*ainmear eas-cruthach* – see above); compound nouns (*ainmear fillte* eg. `taigh-beag`, `cailleach-dhubh`); and verbal nouns (*ainmear gnìomhaireach* eg. `dèanamh`, `ithe`). For present purposes, and with the obvious exception of his ‘compound nouns’ (many of which are not even nouns at all), these are best understood as semantic sub-classes of common noun.
