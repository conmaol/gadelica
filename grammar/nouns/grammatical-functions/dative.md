# Grammatical functions of dative nouns

The only function of a dative noun is to mark the complement of a preposition.

For example:

> Bha eagal **air Fionn** gun tigeadh naimhdean ’athar.
>
> Bha a chasan cho luath **ri casan** féidh.
>
> Nuair a bha Fionn **’na leanabh** beag, mharbhadh ’athair.

In the first sentence here, the dative masculine proper noun `Fionn` is the complement of the preposition `air` ‘on’ – `(bha eagal) air Fionn` ‘(a fear was) on Finn’, ie. ‘Finn was afraid’.

In the second sentence, the dative plural common noun `casan` ‘feet’ is the complement of the preposition ‘ri’ – `(cho luath) ri casan féidh` ‘(as swift) as the feet of a deer’.

In the third sentence, the dative masculine common noun `leanabh` ‘an infant’ is the complement of the fused preposition `’na`, itself a contraction of `ann an a` ‘in his’ – `(bha e) ’na leanabh beag` ‘(he was) in his little infant’, ie. ‘he was a little infant’.

Here are some examples involving (abstract) verbal nouns:

> Chunnaic e lach **a’ snàmh** air loch.
>
> Fhuair i Fionn **’na shuain** chadail.

In the first example, the dative masculine verbal noun `snàmh` ‘swimming’ is the complement of the progressive preposition `a’` – `a’ snàmh` ‘(in the process of) swimming’. 

In the second sentence, the (lenited) dative feminine verbal noun `shuain` ‘slumber’ is the complement of the fused preposition `‘na` ‘in his’ – `‘na shuain` ‘in his slumber’, ie. ‘asleep’.

Notes:

- Unless otherwise specified, examples are adapted from the story *[Fionn](../../texts/Fionn.md)*, in Lachlann MacFhionghuin’s (c.1950) *Leabhraichean Leughaidh: Leabhar II* (pp. 81–82). Examples prefixed with ◊ are more obvious inventions of the editors.

- In modern Gaelic, dative nouns are almost always identical in form to the corresponding nominative noun, though they differ in terms of the articles and adjectives they combine with.
