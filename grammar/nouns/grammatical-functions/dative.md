# Grammatical functions of dative nouns

The only grammatical function of a dative noun is to mark the complement of a preposition.

For example:

> Bha eagal **air Fionn** gun tigeadh naimhdean ’athar.
>
> Bha a chasan cho luath **ri casan** féidh.
>
> Nuair a bha Fionn **’na leanabh** beag, mharbhadh ’athair.

In the first sentence here, the dative masculine proper noun `Fionn` is the complement of the preposition `air` ‘on’ – ‘a fear was on Finn (ie. he was afraid) that his father’s enemies would come’.

In the second sentence, the dative plural common noun `casan` ‘feet’ is the complement of the preposition `ri` ‘as’ – ‘his feet were as swift as a deer’s feet’.

In the third sentence, the dative masculine common noun `leanabh` ‘an infant’ is the complement of the fused preposition `’na`, itself a contraction of `ann an a` ‘in his’ – ‘when Finn was in his little infant (ie. when he was a little infant) his father was killed’.

Here are some examples where an (abstract) verbal noun is the complement of a preposition (or preposition-like verb particle):

> Chunnaic e lach **a’ snàmh** air loch.
>
> Fhuair i Fionn **’na shuain** chadail.

In the first example, the dative masculine verbal noun `snàmh` ‘swimming’ is the complement of the progressive preposition `a’` – ‘he saw a duck (in the process of) swimming on a lake’. 

In the second sentence, the (lenited) dative feminine verbal noun `shuain` ‘slumber’ is the complement of the fused preposition `‘na` ‘in his’ – ‘she found Finn in his sleepy slumber (ie. asleep).

Notes:

- Unless otherwise specified, examples are adapted from the story *[Fionn](../../texts/Fionn.md)*, in Lachlann MacFhionghuin’s (c.1950) *Leabhraichean Leughaidh: Leabhar II* (pp. 81–85). Examples prefixed with ◊ are more obvious inventions of the editors.

- In modern Gaelic, dative nouns are almost always identical in form to the corresponding nominative noun, though they differ in terms of the articles and adjectives they combine with. We have decided to keep things simple by assuming that the noun complement of a (simple) preposition is always dative, even when it lacks explicit dative marking, and this is also true for verbal nouns where the preposition has a more clearly aspectual meaning.
