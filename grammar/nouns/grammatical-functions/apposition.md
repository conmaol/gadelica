# Nouns in apposition

A noun can stand in apposition to another noun (usually of the same case and gender).

Here is an example involving nominative nouns:

> Nuair a bha **Fionn mac** Cumhail ’na leanabh beag, mharbhadh ’athair.

In this sentence, the nominative masculine proper noun `Fionn` and the nominative masculine common noun `mac` are in apposition (and the proper noun `Cumhail` is the specifier of `mac`) – ‘when Finn, Cumhal’s son, was a little infant, his father was killed’.

The next example involves genitive nouns:

> Phòs màthair **Fhinn mhic** Cumhail rìgh àraidh.

In this sentence, the (lenited) genitive masculine proper noun `Fhinn` and the (lenited) genitive masculine common noun `mhic` are in apposition (while `Fhinn` is the specifier of `màthair` and `Cumhail` is the specifier of `mhic`) – ‘the mother of Finn, Cumhal’s son, married an exceptional king’.

Notes:

- Unless otherwise specified, examples are adapted from the story *[Fionn](../../texts/Fionn.md)*, in Lachlann MacFhionghuin’s (c.1950) *Leabhraichean Leughaidh: Leabhar II* (pp. 81–85).

- McCaulay’s (1992) description of Gaelic grammar lists the following interesting example (§4.3.2.1):  
  > `bàta mac Iain mac Sheumais mac Dhòmhnaill` ‘the son of Iain son of Seumas son of Donald’s boat’
  
  This example shows interplay between apposition and [specification](../grammatical-dependents/specifiers/post-specifiers.md) in patronymics. The (lenited) genitive masculine proper noun `Dhòmhnaill` ‘Donald’s’ is the specifier of the third instance of the nominative masculine common noun `mac` ‘a son’, which is itself in apposition to the (lenited) genitive masculine proper noun `Sheumais` ‘James’s’, which is itself the specifier of the second instance of the nominative masculine common noun `mac`, which is itself in apposition to the genitive masculine proper noun `Iain` ‘John’s’, which is itself the specifier of the first instance of the nominative masculine common noun `mac`, which is itself the specifier of the nominative masculine common noun `bàta` ‘a boat’.
