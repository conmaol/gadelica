# Nouns in apposition

A noun can stand in apposition to another noun (usually of the same case and gender).

Here is an example involving nominative nouns:

> Nuair a bha **Fionn mac** Cumhail ’na leanabh beag, mharbhadh ’athair.

In this sentence, the nominative masculine proper noun `Fionn` and the nominative masculine common noun `mac` are in apposition (and the proper noun `Cumhail` is the specifier of `mac`) – ‘when Finn, Cumhal’s son, was a little infant, his father was killed’.

The next example involves genitive nouns:

> Phòs màthair **Fhinn mhic** Cumhail rìgh àraidh.

In this sentence, the (lenited) genitive masculine proper noun `Fhinn` and the (lenited) genitive masculine common noun `mhic` are in apposition (while `Fhinn` is the specifier of `màthair` and `Cumhail` is the specifier of `mhic`) – ‘the mother of Finn, Cumhal’s son, married an exceptional king’.
