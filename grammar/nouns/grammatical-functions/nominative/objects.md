# Nominative nouns as objects of a verb

The second most common function of a nominative noun is to mark the grammatical object of a (transitive) verb.

Here are some examples:

> **Phòs** a mhàthair **rìgh** àraidh.
>
> Cha do **leig** i **Fionn** beag às a h-aire.
>
> **Thilg** e **urchair** air an lach, agus **gheàrr** sin na **sgiathan** aice.

In the first sentence here, the nominative masculine common noun `rìgh` ‘a king’ is the grammatical object of the transitive verb `phòs` ‘married’ – ‘his mother married an exceptional king’.

In the second sentence, the nominative masculine proper noun `Fionn` is the object of the transitive verb `leig` ‘allowed’ – ‘she didn’t allow Finn out of her mind’.

In the third example, the nominative feminine proper noun `urchair` ‘a stone’ is the object of the transitive verb `thilg` ‘threw’, and the nominative plural common noun `sgiathan` ‘wings’ is the object of the transitive verb `gheàrr` ‘cut’ – ‘he threw a stone at the duck, and that cut her wings’.

Here is an example where an (abstract) *verbal* noun is the object of a transitive verb:

> **Leigeadh** na mnathan leis **tighinn** gu tìr mar a b’ fheàrr a dh’fhaodadh e.

In this sentence, the nominative feminine verbal noun `tighinn` ‘coming’ is the grammatical object of the transitive verb `leigeadh` ‘would allow’ – ‘the women would allow him to come to land as best as he could’.

And an example with a subject-less ‘passive’ verb:

> Nuair a bha Fionn ’na leanabh beag, **mharbhadh** ’**athair**.

Here, the nominative masculine common noun `athair` ‘father’ is the grammatical object of the subject-less verb `mharbhadh` ‘someone killed’ – ‘when Finn was a little infant, someone killed his father, ie. his father was killed’.

Finally, here are some examples involving forms of the copula:

> **Is** i siud a’ chiad **shealg** a rinn Fionn.
> 
> B’ e Cumhal a **b’** **ainm** air aon de na daoine seo.

In the first sentence, the nominative feminine common noun `shealg` ‘a hunt’ is the grammatical object (or at least the secondary dependent) of the copula form `is` – ‘that is the first hunt that Finn did’.

In the second sentence, the nominative masculine common noun `ainm` ‘a name’ is the object of the second instance of the copular form `b’` ‘was’ – ‘It was Cumhal that was [the] name of one of these men’.
