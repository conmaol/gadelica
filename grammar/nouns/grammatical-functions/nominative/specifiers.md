# Nominative common nouns as the specifier of a noun

One rather marginal function of a (post-specified) nominative common noun is to be the specifier of another, preceding, noun.

### Background

When a noun is the (post-)specifier of another noun it is usually in the genitive case:

> `Thàinig naimhdean ’athar air tòir an leinibh.` ‘His father’s enemies came in pursuit of the infant.’
>
> `Bha eagal air Fionn Chumhail na Féinne.` ‘Cumhal of the Fenians’s Finn was afraid.’

In the first sentence, the genitive masculine common noun `athar` ‘a father’ is the specifier of the nominative plural common noun `naimhdean` ‘enemies’, and the genitive masculine common noun `leinibh` ‘an infant’ is the specifier of the dative feminine common noun `tòir` ‘a pursuit’.

In the second sentence, the (lenited) genitive masculine proper noun `Chumhail` is the (post-)specifier of the dative masculine proper noun `Fionn`, and itself has a post-specifier, the genitive feminine common noun `Féinne` ‘Fenians’. The second sentence is similar but `Chumail` is the (post-)specifier of a common noun `naimhdean` ‘enemies’.

If any of these specifiers were in the nominative case, then the sentences would be ungrammatical:

> `❌ Thàinig naimhdean ’athair air tòir an leinibh.` 
>
> `❌ Thàinig naimhdean ’athar air tòir an leanabh.`
> 
> `❌ Bha eagal air Fionn Cumhal na Féinne.` 
> 
> `❌ Bha eagal air Fionn Chumhail an Fhiann.` 

### The ‘avoid double genitive’ rule

However, when a noun: (a) is a  common noun; (b) is the specifier of another noun; **and** (c) itself has yet another noun as its own a (post-)specifier, then it must be in the nominative case.

This is knows as the ‘avoid double genitive’ rule.
