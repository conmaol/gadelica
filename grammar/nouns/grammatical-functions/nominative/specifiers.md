# Nominative common nouns as the specifier of a noun

One highly marginal function of a (specified) nominative common noun is to be the specifier of another, preceding, noun.

When a noun is the (post-)specifier of another noun it is usuualy in the [genitive](../genitive/specifiers.md) case.

examples?

But when a noun: (a) is a  common noun; (b) is the specifier of another noun; **and** (c) itself has yet another noun as its own a (post-)specifier, then it must be in the nominative case.

This is knows as the ‘avoid double genitive’ rule.
