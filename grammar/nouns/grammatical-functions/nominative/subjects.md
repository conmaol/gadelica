# Nominative nouns as subjects of a verb

The most common function of a nominative noun is to mark the grammatical subject of a verb.

Here are some examples involving forms of the predicative verb `bi`:

> Nuair a **bha Fionn** ’na leanabh beag, mharbhadh ’athair.
>
> Cha robh e a-riamh ann an sgoil mar a **tha** na **gillean** an-diugh.
>
> Lorg i an t-àite anns an **robh** an **leanabh**.

In the first sentence here, the nominative masculine proper noun `Fionn` is the grammatical subject of the predicative verb form `bha` ‘was’ – ‘when Finn was a little infant, his father was killed’.

In the second sentence, the nominative plural common noun `gillean` ‘boys’ is the subject of the predicative verb form `tha` ‘is, are’ – ‘he was never in school like the boys are today’.

In the third sentence, the nominative masculine common noun `leanabh` ‘infant’ is the subject of the predicative verb form `robh` ‘was, were’ – ‘she found the place in which the infant was’.

Here are some sentences involving other verbs:

> Bha eagal air a mhathair gun **tigeadh naimhdean** ’athar air tòir an leinibh.
>
> **Phòs** a **mhàthair** rìgh àraidh.
>
> Is i siud a’ chiad shealg a **rinn** **Fionn**.

In the first example here, the nominative plural common noun `naimhdean` ‘enemies’ is the subject of the verb `tigeadh` ‘would come’ – ‘his mother was afraid that his father’s enemies would come in pursuit of the infant’.

In the second example, the nominative feminine common noun `màthair` ‘mother’ is the subject of the verb `phòs` ‘married’ – ‘his mother married an exceptional king’.

In the third example, the nominative masculine proper noun `Fionn` is the subject of the verb `rinn` ‘did’ – ‘that was the first hunt that Finn did’.

Finally, here is an example involving a form of the copula:

> **B’** e **Cumhal** a b’ ainm air aon de na daoine seo.

Here, the nominative masculine proper noun `Cumhal` is the grammatical subject (or at least the first dependent) of the copula form `b’` ‘was, were’ – ‘it was Cumhal that was the name of one of these men’.
