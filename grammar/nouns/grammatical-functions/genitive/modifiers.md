# Genitive nouns as modifiers of a noun

One of the main functions of a genitive common noun is to mark a modifier of a preceding noun.

Here are a couple of examples:

> Fhuair i e ’na **shuain chadail**.
>
> Bha an **dithis bhan** ud a’ toirt an aire air gus an do dh’fhàs e suas.

In the first sentence here, the (lenited) genitive masculine (verbal) noun `chadail` ‘sleeping’ is a modifier of the (lenited) dative feminine (verbal) noun `shuain` ‘slumber’ – ‘she found him in sleepy slumber’.

In the second example, the (lenited) genitive plural common noun `bhan` ‘women’ is a modifier of the nominative feminine common noun `dithis` ‘a group of two people’ – ‘those two women watched over him until he grew up’.
