# Genitive nouns as specifiers of a noun

One of the main functions of a genitive noun is to mark the specifier of a preceding noun.

Here are a couple of examples:

> Bha a chasan cho luath ri **casan féidh**.
>
> Bha eagal air a mhàthair gun tigeadh **naimhdean** ’**athar** air **tòir** an **leinibh**.

In the first example here, the genitive masculine common noun `féidh` ‘deer’ is the specifier of the dative plural common noun `casan` ‘feet’ – ‘his feet were as swift as a deer’s feet’. 

In the second example, the genitive masculine common noun `athar` ‘a father’ is the specifier of the nominative plural common noun `naimhdean` ‘enemies’, and the genitive masculine common noun `leinibh` ‘an infant’ is the specifier of the dative feminine common noun `tòir` ‘a pursuit’ – ‘his mother was afraid that his father’s enemies would come in pursuit of the infant’.

*Proper* nouns too can function as specifiers, of both common and proper nouns:

> Phòs **màthair Fhinn** rìgh àraidh.
>
> Nuair a bha **Fionn Chumhail** ’na leanabh beag, mharbhadh ’athair.

In the first example, the (lenited) genitive masculine proper noun `Fhinn` is the specifier of the nominative feminine common noun `màthair` ‘mother’  – ‘Finn’s mother married an exceptional king’.

In the second example, the (lenited) genitive masculine proper noun `Chumhail` is the specifier of the nominative masculine proper noun `Fionn` – ‘when Cumhal’s Finn was a little infant, his father was killed’.

Finally, when a genitive noun is the specifier of a *verbal* noun, it typically marks what would have been the *object* of the underlying verb:

> Cha robh e a’ **cur** seachad a **làithean** ’na thàmh.

Here, the genitive plural common noun `làithean` ‘days’ is the specifier of the dative masculine verbal noun `cur` ‘sending’ – ‘he was not spending his days at ease’.
