# Genitive nouns as specifiers of a noun

One of the main functions of a genitive noun is to mark the specifier of a preceding noun.

Here are a couple of examples:

> `Bha a chasan cho luath ri casan féidh.` ‘His feet were as swift as a deer’s feet.’
>
> `Thàinig naimhdean ’athar air tòir an leinibh.` ‘His father’s enemies came in pursuit of the infant.’

In the first example here, the genitive masculine common noun `féidh` ‘deer’ is the specifier of the dative plural common noun `casan` ‘feet’. 

In the second example, the genitive masculine common noun `athar` ‘a father’ is the specifier of the nominative plural common noun `naimhdean` ‘enemies’, and the genitive masculine common noun `leinibh` ‘an infant’ is the specifier of the dative feminine common noun `tòir` ‘a pursuit’.

*Proper* nouns too can function as specifiers, of both common and proper nouns:

> `Phòs màthair Fhinn rìgh àraidh.` ‘Finn’s mother married an exceptional king.’
>
> `Nuair a bha Fionn Chumhail ’na leanabh beag, mharbhadh ’athair.` ‘When Cumhal’s Finn was a little infant, his father was killed.’

In the first example, the (lenited) genitive masculine proper noun `Fhinn` is the specifier of the nominative feminine common noun `màthair` ‘a mother’.

In the second example, the (lenited) genitive masculine proper noun `Chumhail` is the specifier of the nominative masculine proper noun `Fionn` – ‘’.

When a genitive noun is the specifier of a *verbal* noun, it typically marks what would have been the *object* of the underlying verb:

> `Cha robh e a’ cur seachad a làithean ’na thàmh.` ‘He was not spending his days at ease.’

Here, the genitive plural common noun `làithean` ‘days’ is the specifier of the dative masculine verbal noun `cur` ‘sending’.

Notes:

- Unless otherwise specified, examples are adapted from the story *[Fionn](../../../texts/Fionn.md)*, in Lachlann MacFhionghuin’s (c.1950) *Leabhraichean Leughaidh: Leabhar II* (pp. 81–85).

- Note, however, that not all common nouns that are the specifier of a preceding noun are genitive nouns. According to the rule of ‘double genitive avoidance’, a common noun which is the (post-)specifier of another noun, whilst having yet another noun as its own (post-)specifier, must appear in the [nominative](../nominative/specifiers.md) case rather than in the genitive.
