# Bare nouns

If a noun has no grammatical dependents of any kind, it is known as a ‘bare’ noun.

*Proper nouns* usually occur bare.

> B’ e **Cumhal** a b’ ainm air aon de na daoine seo, agus bha mac aige air an robh **Fionn**.
>
> Is i siud a’ chiad shealg a rinn **Fionn**.

Note that unless otherwise specified all examples are adapted from the *[Fionn](../../Fionn.md)* text. Where appropriate, invented examples are marked as ◊.

In these two examples, the nominative masculine proper nouns `Cumhal` and `Fionn` are both bare of grammatical dependents, even though they are themselves dependents (specifically subjects) of verbs, respectively `b’` ‘was’, `robh` ‘was’ and `rinn` ‘did’. 

*Common nouns* can also appear bare, in which case they have ‘indefinite’, unmodified meaning.

> Latha de na làithean chaidh e a-mach agus chunnaic e lach a’ snàmh air **loch**.
>
> Thilg e **urchair** oirre, agus gheàrr sin na sgiathan aice.
> 
> Bha aige ri an cumail ’nan cròileagan cruinn ann am badan àraidh, agus is ann le bhith sìor ruith timcheall orra a bha a chasan mu dheireadh cho luath ri casan **féidh**.

All three of the common nouns highlighted here lack any grammatical dependents, although they are all themselves dependents of other words in the sentence. The dative masculine noun `loch` ‘a lake’ is the complement of the preposition `air` ‘on’; the nominative feminine noun `urchair` ‘a shot, a stone’ is the object of the verb `thilg` ‘threw’; and the genitive masculine noun `féidh` ‘a deer’ is the specifier of the plural common noun `casan` ‘feet’.
