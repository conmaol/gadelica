# Bare nouns

If a noun has no grammatical dependents of any kind, it is known as a ‘bare’ noun.

*Proper nouns* usually occur bare:

> `B’ e Cumhal a b’ ainm air aon de na daoine seo.` ‘It was Cumhal that was [the] name of one of these men.’
>
> `Is i siud a’ chiad shealg a rinn Fionn.` ‘That is the first hunt that Finn did.’

In these two examples, the nominative masculine proper nouns `Cumhal` and `Fionn` are both bare of grammatical dependents, even though they are themselves dependents (specifically subjects of verbs). 

*Common nouns* can also appear bare, in which case they have ‘indefinite’, unmodified meaning:

> `Chunnaic e lach a’ snàmh air loch.` ‘He saw a duck swimming on a lake.’
>
> `Thilg e urchair oirre.` ‘He threw a stone at her.’
> 
> `Bha a chasan mu dheireadh cho luath ri casan féidh.` ‘His feet were as swift as a deer’s feet.’

Three of the common nouns here are bare:
- the dative masculine noun `loch` ‘a lake’ (which is the complement of the preposition `air` ‘on’)
- the nominative feminine noun `urchair` ‘a stone’ (which is the object of the verb `thilg` ‘threw’)
- the genitive masculine noun `féidh` ‘a deer’ (which is the specifier of the noun `casan` ‘feet’)
