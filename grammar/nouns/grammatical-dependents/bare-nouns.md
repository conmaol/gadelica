# Bare nouns

If a noun has no grammatical dependents of any kind, it is known as a ‘bare’ noun.

*Proper nouns* usually occur bare:

> B’ e **Cumhal** a b’ ainm air aon de na daoine seo, agus bha mac aige air an robh **Fionn**.
>
> Is i siud a’ chiad shealg a rinn **Fionn**.

In these two examples, the nominative masculine proper nouns `Cumhal` and `Fionn` are both bare of grammatical dependents, even though they are themselves dependents (specifically subjects of verbs) – ‘It was Cumhal that was [the] name of one of these men, and he had a son on whom was [the name] Finn’; ‘That is the first hunt that Finn did’. 

*Common nouns* can also appear bare, in which case they have ‘indefinite’, unmodified meaning:

> Chunnaic e lach a’ snàmh air **loch**.
>
> Thilg e **urchair** oirre.
> 
> Bha a chasan mu dheireadh cho luath ri casan **féidh**.

All three of the common nouns highlighted here lack any grammatical dependents, although they are all themselves dependents of other words in the sentence. The dative masculine noun `loch` ‘a lake’ is the complement of the preposition `air` ‘on’ – ‘he saw a duck swimming on a lake’; the nominative feminine noun `urchair` ‘a shot, a stone’ is the object of the verb `thilg` ‘threw’ – ‘he threw a stone at her’; and the genitive masculine noun `féidh` ‘a deer’ is the specifier of the plural common noun `casan` ‘feet’ – ‘his feet were as swift as a deer’s feet’.
