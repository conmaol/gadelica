# Specifiers

A noun can have no more than one specifier, which can be either:

- a [determiner](determiners.md) as pre-specifier, eg. `na caoraich` ‘the sheep’, `bhur caoraich` ‘your sheep’
- a noun as [post-specifier](post-specifiers.md), eg. `caoraich Sheumais` ‘James’s sheep’, `caoraich a’ Mhinisteir` ‘the Minister’s sheep’

Note that a noun can have *no* specifier whatsoever, in which case it has ‘indefinite’ meaning:

`Tha caoraich anns a’ mhonadh.` ‘There are sheep on the moor.’

Secondly, a noun cannot have *both* a pre-specifier *and* a post-specifier:

`❌ na caoraich Sheumais` ‘the James’s sheep’

`❌ na caoraich a’ Mhinisteir` ‘the Minister’s sheep’

Finally, a proper noun can *only* have a post-specifier and *not* a pre-specifier:

`Seumas a’ Mhinisteir` ‘the Minister’s James’

`❌ mo Sheumas` ‘my James’
