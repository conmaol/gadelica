# Specifiers

A noun can have no more than one specifier, which can be either:

- a [determiner](determiners.md) as pre-specifier, eg. `na caoraich` ‘the sheep’
- a noun as [post-specifier](post-specifiers.md), eg. `caoraich Sheumais` ‘James’s sheep’, `caoraich a’ Mhinisteir` ‘the Minister’s sheep’

A noun can have no specifier whatsoever, in which case it has ‘indefinite’ meaning:

> Tha **caoraich** anns a’ mhonadh. ‘There are sheep on the moor.’

However, a noun cannot have both a pre-specifier and a post-specifier:

> ❌ na caoraich Sheumais ‘the James’s sheep’
>
> ❌ na caoraich a’ Mhinisteir ‘the Minister’s sheep’

Finally, a proper noun can only have a post-specifier and *not* a pre-specifier:

> ❌ mo Sheumas ‘my James’
>
> Seumas a’ Mhinisteir ‘the Minister’s James’
