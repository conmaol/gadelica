# Specifiers of nouns

A noun can have no more than one specifier, which can be either:

- a [determiner](determiners.md) as pre-specifier, eg. `na caoraich` ‘the sheep’, `bhur caoraich` ‘your sheep’
- a noun as [post-specifier](post-specifiers.md), eg. `caoraich Chumhail` ‘Cumhal’s sheep’, `caoraich an rìgh` ‘the king’s sheep’

A noun can have *no* specifier whatsoever, in which case it has ‘indefinite’ meaning:

> `Tha caoraich anns an achadh.` ‘There are sheep in the field.’

A noun cannot have *both* a pre-specifier *and* a post-specifier:

> `❌ na caoraich Chumhail` (for ‘the sheep of Cumhal’)
>
>`❌ na caoraich an rìgh` (for ‘the sheep of the king’)

A proper noun can *only* have a post-specifier and *not* a pre-specifier:

> `Cumhal an rìgh` ‘the king’s Cumhal’ (ie. the man named Cumhal who is the son of, or otherwise connected with, the king)
>
>`❌ mo Chumhal` (for ‘my Cumhal’)
