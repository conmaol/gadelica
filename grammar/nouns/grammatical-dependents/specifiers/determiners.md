# Determiners as pre-specifiers of nouns

A *common* noun can have a pre-specifier, which must be either a form of the definite article, or another determiner.

In the following example, the definite article form `an` ‘the’ is the specifier of the nominative masculine common noun `saoghal` ‘world’:

> `Nuair a bha an saoghal òg bha daoine treuna ann`. ‘When the world was young, there were brave men.’

In the next example, the determiner `gach` ‘every’ is the specifier of the masculine common noun `latha` ‘day’:

> `Bhiodh e a’ snàmh gach dàrna latha.` ‘He would be swimming every other day.’

Finally, in the next example, the incorporated personal determiner `a` ‘his’ within the orthographically fused preposition `’na` (ie. `ann an a` ‘in his’) is the specifier of the dative masculine common noun `leanabh` ‘an infant’:

> `Bha Fionn ’na leanabh beag.` ‘Finn was a little infant.’ (literally, ‘Finn was in his little infant’)

Note that a *proper* noun cannot have a determiner as pre-specifier:

> `❌ Bha mo Fhionn a’ snàmh.` (for ‘My Finn was swimming.’)
>
> `❌ Mharbhadh gach Cumhal.` (for ‘Every (man called) Cumhal was killed.’)
