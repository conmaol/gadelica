# Post-specifiers of nouns

A noun can have a post-specifier, which is usually a genitive noun.

### Common nouns

Here are some examples of common nouns with post-specifiers:

> `Thàinig naimhdean ’athar air tòir an leinibh.` ‘His father’s enemies came in pursuit of the infant.’
> 
> `Phòs màthair Fhinn rìgh àraidh.` ‘Finn’s mother married an exceptional king.’

In the first sentence, the genitive masculine common noun `athar` ‘a father’ is the specifier of the nominative plural common noun `naimhdean` ‘enemies’, and the genitive masculine common noun `leinibh` ‘an infant’ is the specifier of the dative feminine common noun `tòir` ‘a pursuit’.

In the second sentence, the (lenited) genitive masculine proper noun `Fhinn` is the specifier of the nominative feminine common noun `màthair` ‘mother’.

### Proper nouns

Here are some examples of proper nouns with post-specifiers:

> `Nuair a bha Fionn Chumhail ’na leanabh beag, mharbhadh ’athair.` ‘When Cumhal’s Finn was a little infant, his father was killed.’
>
> `Bha mac aig Cumhal na Féinne.` ‘Cumhal of the Fenians had a son.’

In the first sentence here, the (lenited) genitive masculine proper noun `Chumhail` is the specifier of the nominative masculine proper noun `Fionn`.

In the second sentence, the genitive feminine common noun `Féinne` ‘Fenians’ is the specifier of the dative masculine proper noun `Cumhal`.

### Pre-specifiers of (post-)specifiers

By extension, a (genitive) common noun which is the (post-)specifier of another noun can itself have a determiner as pre-specifier.

> `Thàinig naimhdean ’athar air tòir an leinibh.` ‘His father’s enemies came in pursuit of the infant.’
>
> `Bha mac aig Cumhal na Féinne.` ‘Cumhal of the Fenians had a son.’

In the first sentence here, the genitive masculine common noun `athar` ‘a father’ is the post-specifier of the nominative plural common `naimhdean` ‘enemies’, but it also has its own (pre-)specifier, the personal determiner `a` ‘his’ (elided in the orthography here).

Similarly, the genitive masculine common noun `leinibh` ‘an infant’ is the post-specifier of the dative feminine common noun `tòir` ‘a pursuit’, but it too has its own pre-specifier, the definite article `an` ‘the’.

In the second sentence, the genitive feminine common noun `Féinne` ‘Fenians’ is the specifier of the dative masculine proper noun `Cumhal`, whilst also having its own pre-specifier, the definite article `na` ‘the’.

### Post-specifiers of (post-)specifiers

#### Proper nouns

Similarly, a (genitive) proper noun which is the (post-)specifier of another noun can itself have a (genitive) noun as post-specifier.

> `Bha eagal air Fionn Chumhail na Féinne.` ‘Cumhal of the Fenians’s Finn was afraid.’
> 
> `Thàinig naimhdean Chumhail na Féinne.` ‘Cumhal of the Fenians’s enemies came.’
>
> `Bha eagal air Finn Chumhail Oisein.` ‘Ossian’s Cumhal’s Finn was afraid.’
> 
> `Thàinig naimhdean Chumhail Oisein.` ‘Ossian’s Cumhal’s enemies came.’

In the first sentence here, the (lenited) genitive masculine proper noun `Chumhail` is the (post-)specifier of the dative masculine proper noun `Fionn`, and itself has a post-specifier, the genitive feminine common noun `Féinne` ‘Fenians’. The second sentence is similar but `Chumail` is the (post-)specifier of a common noun `naimhdean` ‘enemies’.

In the third and fourth sentences, `Chumail` functions in the same way as before but in these cases has the genitive masculine *proper* noun `Oisein` ‘Ossian’ as its own specifier.

#### Common nouns

With common noun specifiers things are slightly more complicated.

A genitive common noun which is the (post-)specifier of another noun *cannot* have a noun as post-specifier, exemplified by genitive masculine `athar` ‘a father’ in the following ungrammatical sentences:

> `❌ Thàinig naimhdean athar Fhinn.` (for ‘Finn’s father’s enemies came.’)

> `❌ Thàinig naimhdean athar an leinibh.` (for ‘The infant’s father’s enemies came.’)

However, if the intermediate common noun is nominative (ie. `athair`) then this is okay:

> `Thàinig naimhdean athair Fhinn.` ‘Finn’s father’s enemies came.’

> `Thàinig naimhdean athair an leinibh.` ‘The infant’s father’s enemies came.’)

This is the ‘double genitive avoidance’ rule which holds in Gaelic:

> **A common noun which is the (post-)specifier of another noun, whilst having yet another noun as its own (post-)specifier, must appear in the nominative case rather than in the genitive.**

Notes:

- Unless otherwise specified, examples are adapted from the story *[Fionn](../../../texts/Fionn.md)*, in Lachlann MacFhionghuin’s (c.1950) *Leabhraichean Leughaidh: Leabhar II* (pp. 81–85).

- It is unclear what happens in those edge cases where a common noun is the (post-)specifier of a proper noun and has its own post-specifier:
  > `⁉️ Thàinig Oisean atha[i]r Fhinn.` ‘Finn’s father’s Ossian came.’  
  > `⁉️ Thàinig Oisean atha[i]r an leinibh.` ‘The infant’s father’s Ossian came.’)

- McCaulay’s (1992) description lists two interesting examples (§4.3.2.1):
  > `bàta mac Chaluim` ‘Calum’s son’s boat’  
  > `bàta mac Iain mac Sheumais mac Dhòmhnaill` ‘the son of Iain son of Seumas son of Donald’s boat’
  
  The first example illustrates double genitive avoidance with common nouns. The (lenited) genitive masculine proper noun `Chaluim` is the specifier of the *nominative* masculine common noun `mac` ‘a son’, which is itself the specifier of the nominative masculine common noun `bàta` ‘a boat’.  
  
  The second example shows interplay between specification and [apposition](../../grammatical-functions/apposition.md) in patronymics. The (lenited) genitive masculine proper noun `Dhòmhnaill` ‘Donald’s’ is the specifier of the third instance of the nominative masculine common noun `mac` ‘a son’, which is itself in apposition to the (lenited) genitive masculine proper noun `Sheumais` ‘James’s’, which is itself the specifier of the second instance of the nominative masculine common noun `mac`, which is itself in apposition to the genitive masculine proper noun `Iain` ‘John’s’, which is itself the specifier of the first instance of the nominative masculine common noun `mac`, which is itself the specifier of the nominative masculine common noun `bàta` ‘a boat’.
