# Post-specifiers of nouns

A noun can have a post-specifier, which is usually a genitive noun.

### Common nouns

Here are some examples of common nouns with post-specifiers:

> `Thàinig naimhdean ’athar air tòir an leinibh.` ‘His father’s enemies came in pursuit of the infant.’
> 
> `Phòs màthair Fhinn rìgh àraidh.` ‘Finn’s mother married an exceptional king.’

In the first sentence, the genitive masculine common noun `athar` ‘a father’ is the specifier of the nominative plural common noun `naimhdean` ‘enemies’, and the genitive masculine common noun `leinibh` ‘an infant’ is the specifier of the dative feminine common noun `tòir` ‘a pursuit’.

In the second sentence, the (lenited) genitive masculine proper noun `Fhinn` is the specifier of the nominative feminine common noun `màthair` ‘mother’.

### Proper nouns

Here are some examples of proper nouns with post-specifiers:

> `Nuair a bha Fionn Chumhail ’na leanabh beag, mharbhadh ’athair.` ‘When Cumhal’s Finn was a little infant, his father was killed.’
>
> `Bha mac aig Cumhal na Féinne.` ‘Cumhal of the Fenians had a son.’

In the first sentence here, the (lenited) genitive masculine proper noun `Chumhail` is the specifier of the nominative masculine proper noun `Fionn`.

In the second sentence, the genitive feminine common noun `Féinne` ‘Fenians’ is the specifier of the dative masculine proper noun `Cumhal`.

### Pre-specifiers of (post-)specifiers

A genitive common noun which is the (post-)specifier of another noun can itself have a determiner as pre-specifier.

> `Thàinig naimhdean ’athar air tòir an leinibh.` ‘His father’s enemies came in pursuit of the infant.’
>
> `Bha mac aig Cumhal na Féinne.` ‘Cumhal of the Fenians had a son.’

In the first sentence here, the genitive masculine common noun `athar` ‘a father’ is the post-specifier of the nominative plural common `naimhdean` ‘enemies’, but it also has its own (pre-)specifier, the personal determiner `a` ‘his’ (elided in the orthography here).

Similarly, the genitive masculine common noun `leinibh` ‘an infant’ is the post-specifier of the dative feminine common noun `tòir` ‘a pursuit’, but it too has its own pre-specifier, the definite article `an` ‘the’.

In the second sentence, the genitive feminine common noun `Féinne` ‘Fenians’ is the specifier of the dative masculine proper noun `Cumhal`, whilst also having its own pre-specifier, the definite article `na` ‘the’.

### Post-specifiers of (post-)specifiers

#### Proper nouns

A genitive proper noun which is the (post-)specifier of another noun can itself have a genitive noun as post-specifier.

> `Bha eagal air Fionn Chumhail na Féinne.`
> 
> `Thàinig naimhdean Chumhail na Féinne.`
> 
> `Bha eagal air Oisean Fhinn Chumhail (na Féinne).`
> 
> `Thàinig naimhdean Fhinn Chumhail (na Féinne).`

#### Common nouns

**When a noun is both (post-)specifier of another noun and has yet another noun as its own (post-)specifier, then that (intermediate) noun must appear in the nominative case rather than in the genitive.**

> Thàinig **naimhdean athair** an **leinibh**.

Here, the genitive masculine common noun `leinibh` ‘an infant’ is the specifier of the nominative masculine common noun `athair` ‘a father’, which is itself the specifier of the nominative plural common noun `naimhdean` ‘enemies’ – ‘the infant’s father’s enemies came’. If the intermediate noun were genitive, then the sentence would be ungrammatical – 

> ❌ Thàinig naimhdean **athar** an leinibh.


Thàinig naimhdean athair Fhinn. 

Thàinig naimhdean Fhinn Chumhail. ??

Thàinig naimhdean Chumhail na Féinne. ??

Thàinig Fionn Chumhail na Féinne.

Note that a common noun cannot have both a pre-specifier and a post-specifier (at the same time) – the only way of translating ‘the enemies of his father’ into Gaelic is `naimhdean a athar` and certainly not `* na naimhdean a athar`.

  > (206) bàta mac Chaluim
  >
  > The (lenited) genitive masculine proper noun `Chaluim` is the specifier of the nominative masculine common noun `mac` ‘a son’, which is itself the specifier of the nominative masculine common noun `bàta` ‘a boat’ – ‘Calum’s son’s boat’.
