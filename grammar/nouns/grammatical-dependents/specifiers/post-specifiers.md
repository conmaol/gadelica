# Post-specifiers of nouns

The specifier of a noun can be a following noun, usually a genitive noun.

### Common nouns

Here are some examples of common nouns with post-specifiers:

> Bha eagal air a mhathair gun tigeadh **naimhdean ’athar** air **tòir** an **leinibh**.
> 
> Phòs **màthair Fhinn** rìgh àraidh.

In the first sentence, the genitive masculine common noun `athar` ‘a father’ is the specifier of the nominative plural common noun `naimhdean` ‘enemies’, and the genitive masculine common noun `leinibh` ‘an infant’ is the specifier of the dative feminine common noun `tòir` ‘a pursuit’ – ‘his mother was afraid that his father’s enemies would come in pursuit of the infant’.

In the second sentence, the genitive masculine proper noun `Fhinn` is the specifier of the nominative feminine common noun `màthair` – ‘Finn’s mother married an exceptional king’.

### Proper nouns

Here are some examples of proper nouns with post-specifiers:

> Nuair a bha **Fionn Chumhail** ’na leanabh beag, mharbhadh ’athair.
>
> Bha mac aig **Cumhal** na **Féinne**.

In the first sentence here, the (lenited) genitive masculine proper noun `Chumhaill` is the specifier of the nominative masculine proper noun `Fionn` – ‘when Cumhal’s Finn was a little infant, his father was killed’.

In the second sentence, the genitive feminine common noun `Féinne` is the specifier of the dative masculine proper noun `Cumhal` – ‘Cumhal of the Fenians had a son’.

### Embedding of specifiers

A noun which is the specifier of another noun, can itself have a specifier.

> Thàinig **naimhdean ’athar**.

Here, the genitive masculine common noun `athar` ‘a father’ is, as discussed above, the (post-)specifier of the nominative plural common `naimhdean` ‘enemies’, but it also has its own (pre-)specifier, the personal determiner `a` ‘his’ (elided in the orthography here) – ‘his father’s enemies came’.

**When a noun is both (post-)specifier of another noun and has yet another noun as its own (post-)specifier, then that (intermediate) noun must appear in the nominative case rather than in the genitive.**

> Thàinig **naimhdean athair** an **leinibh**.

Here, the genitive masculine common noun `leinibh` ‘an infant’ is the specifier of the nominative masculine common noun `athair` ‘a father’, which is itself the specifier of the nominative plural common noun `naimhdean` ‘enemies’ – ‘the infant’s father’s enemies came’. If the intermediate noun were genitive, then the sentence would be ungrammatical – 

> ❌ Thàinig naimhdean **athar** an leinibh.


Thàinig naimhdean athair Fhinn. 

Thàinig naimhdean Fhinn Chumhail. ??

Thàinig naimhdean Chumhail na Féinne. ??

Thàinig Fionn Chumhail na Féinne.

Note that a common noun cannot have both a pre-specifier and a post-specifier (at the same time) – the only way of translating ‘the enemies of his father’ into Gaelic is `naimhdean a athar` and certainly not `* na naimhdean a athar`.

- McCaulay (1992: 191)
  > (206) bàta mac Chaluim
  >
  > The (lenited) genitive masculine proper noun `Chaluim` is the specifier of the nominative masculine common noun `mac` ‘a son’, which is itself the specifier of the nominative masculine common noun `bàta` ‘a boat’ – ‘Calum’s son’s boat’.
