## Adjectives as modifiers of nouns

A noun can have one or more adjective modifiers.

*Proper nouns* can be modified by adjectives.

> Phòs a mhàthair rìgh àraidh an déidh sin, ach cha do leig i **Fionn beag** as a h-aire.

In the above example, the nominative masculine proper noun `Fionn` is modified by the adjective `beag` – `Fionn beag` ‘little Finn’.

*Common nouns* can be modified by adjectives too.

> Nuair a bha an saoghal òg bha **daoine treuna** ann, ris an canadh iad an Fhiann.
> 
> Nuair a bha Fionn ’na **leanabh beag**, mharbhadh ’athair ann an aon de na blàraibh a chuir an Fhiann ’nam measg fhéin.
> 
> Sheinn i **crònan milis binn** dha, agus an sin thog i oirre.

In the first of these examples, the nominative plural common noun `daoine` is modified by the adjective `treuna` – `daoine treuna` ‘strong men’. In the second example, the dative masculine common noun `leanabh` is modified by the adjective `beag` – `leanabh beag` ‘a little infant’. 

In the third example, the nominative masculine common noun `crònan` ‘tune’ has not one but *two* adjective modifiers, `milis` ‘sweet’ and `binn` ‘melodious’ – `crònan milis binn` ‘a sweet melodious tune’.

## Genitive common nouns as modifiers of other nouns

A noun can have a genitive common noun modifier.

*Common nouns* can be modified by *non-plural* (feminine or masculine) genitive common nouns.

> Fhuair i e ’na **shuain chadail**, agus thog i e ’na làmhan gu sèimh socrach, agus phòg i e.

In this example, the dative feminine common noun `shuain` ‘slumber’ is modified by the masculine genitive common noun `chadail` ‘sleep’ – `shuain chadail` ‘slumber of sleep, sleepy slumber’.

Common nouns can also be modified by *plural* genitive common nouns.

> Bha an **dithis bhan** ud a’ toirt an aire air gus an do dh’fhàs e suas.

The nominative feminine common noun `dithis` ‘a group of two people’ is modified by the plural genitive common noun `bhan` ‘women’ – `dithis bhan` ‘a group of two women, a female pair’.

We will postpone, for now, the question of whether *proper nouns* can also be modified by (singular or plural) genitive common nouns.

## Prepositions as modifiers of nouns

A noun can have one or more prepositions as modifiers.

*Common nouns* can be modified by prepositions (which themselves take other nouns as their complements).

> B’ e Cumhal a b’ **ainm air** aon de na daoine seo, agus bha mac aige air an robh Fionn.
>
> Dh’fhalbh i **astar** fada **tro** thìr fhàsail gus an do lorg i an t-àite anns an robh an leanabh.
>
> Rachadh e a-mach don achadh far an robh **gearrain gu** leòr a’ ruith bho chnoc gu cnoc.

In the first example, the nominative masculine common noun `ainm` ‘name’ is modified by the preposition `air` ‘on’ (which itself has the complement `aon` ‘one’) – `ainm air aon de na daoine seo` ‘a name on (of) one of these men’. In the second example, the common noun `astar` ‘distance’ is modified by the preposition `tro` ‘through’ – `astar fada tro thìr fhàsail` ‘a long distance through desolate land’.

In the third example, the nominative plural common noun `gearrain` ‘hares’ is modified by the preposition `gu` ‘to’ (which itself has the complement `leòr` ‘sufficiency’) – `gearrain gu leòr` ‘hares to sufficiency, enough hares’.

Prepositional pronouns can be modifiers of common nouns all on their own.

> Thilg e urchair oirre, agus gheàrr sin na **sgiathan aice**.

Here, the nominative plural common noun `sgiathan` ‘wings’ is modified by the prepositional pronoun `aice` ‘at her’ – `sgiathan aice` ‘wings at her, her wings’.

Also, the progressive particle `ag` counts as a preposition in this respect.

> Latha de na làithean chaidh e mach agus chunnaic e **lach a’** snàmh air loch.

In this example, the nominative feminine common noun `lach` ‘duck’ is modified by the particle `a’` (which itself takes the dative noun `snàmh` ‘swimming’ as its complement) – `lach a’ snàmh air loch` ‘a duck swimming in a lake’.

*Proper nouns* can also be modified by prepositions.

> ◊ Mharbhadh **Cumhall à** Glaschu.

Here, the preposition `à` ‘from’ is a modifier of the proper noun `Cumhall` – `Cumhall à Glaschu` ‘Cumhall from Glasgow’.

Notes:
  
- Strictly speaking, it is the preposition itself which is the grammatical modifier of the noun in these examples, and not the whole prepositional phrase. Grammatical relations, as we understand them, are between individual words and not between words and phrases.

## Relative clause particles as modifiers of nouns

A noun can have one of the relative clause particles as a modifier – `a`, `nach`, `far`, `anns (an)`, etc.

### The positive relative clause particle *a*

Both proper and common nouns can be modified by the positive relative clause particle `a`.

> ◊ Mharbhadh **Cumhal**, **a** bha ’na rìgh àraidh.
> 
> Is i siud a’ chiad **shealg a** rinn Fionn.

In the first example, the nominative masculine proper noun `Cumhal` is modified by the particle `a` (which itself has the verb `bha` as its complement) – `Cumhal, a bha ’na rìgh àraidh` ‘Cumhal, who was an exceptional king’

In the second example, the nominative feminine common noun `shealg` ‘a hunt’ is similarly modified by the particle `a` (which here takes the verb `rinn` ‘did’ as its complement) – `a’ chiad shealg a rinn Fionn` ‘the first hunt that Finn did’.

### The negative relative clause particle *nach*

Similarly, both proper and common nouns can be modified by the negative relative clause particle `nach`.

> ◊ Mharbhadh **Cumhal**, **nach** robh ’na rìgh àraidh.
>
> ◊ Is e siud am **balach** **nach** deach a-mach don achadh.

In the first example, the nominative masculine proper noun `Cumhal` is modified by the particle `nach` (which itself has the verb `robh` ‘was’ as its complement) – `Cumhal, nach robh ’na rìgh àraidh` ‘Cumhal, who was not an exceptional king’

In the second example, the nominative masculine common noun `balach` ‘boy’ is similarly modified by the particle `a` (which here takes the verb `deach` ‘went’ as its complement) – `am balach nach deach a-mach don achadh` ‘the boy who did not go out to the field’.

### The locative relative clause particle *far*

The locative relative clause particle `far` ‘where’ can also be used to modify both common and proper nouns (specifically those denoting places).

> Rachadh e a-mach don **achadh** **far** an robh gearrain gu leòr a’ ruith bho chnoc gu cnoc.
>
> ◊ Bha Fionn ann an **Glaschu**, **far** an do mharbhadh ’athair.

In the first example, the dative masculine common noun `achadh` ‘field’ is modified by the particle `far` (which takes as its complement the positive interrogative verb particle `an`) – `an t-achadh far an robh gearrain a’ ruith` ‘the field where hares were running’.

In the second example, it is the proper noun `Glaschu` ‘Glasgow’ which is modified by `far` – `Glaschu, far an do mharbhadh ’athair` ‘Glasgow, where his father was killed’.

### Prepositional relative clause particles

Both proper nouns and common nouns can also be modified by prepositional relative clause particles.

> ◊ Mharbhadh **Cumhall**, **aig** an robh dithis bhan.
>
> Nuair a bha an saoghal òg bha **daoine** treuna ann, **ris** an canadh iad an Fhiann.

In the first example here, the nominative masculine proper noun `Cumhall` is modified by the prepositional relative `aig` – `Cumhall, aig an robh dithis bhan` ‘Cumhall, who had two wives’.

In the second example here, the nominative plural common noun `daoine` ‘men’ is modified by the prepositional relative clause particle `ris` – `na daoine ris an canadh iad an Fhiann` ‘the men against whom they would say the Fenians (ie. the men whom they would call the Fenians)’.

## Lenition of noun modifiers

Prepositions and relative clause particles are grammatical function words, and hence are not lenitable.

However, many adjectives and genitive common nouns *are* lenitable, and those which modify nouns may or may not lenite depending (mainly) on the gender and case of the noun they modify.

### No lenition

When an adjective or genitive noun modifies a *nominative masculine* noun, it is never lenited.

> Cha do leig i **Fionn beag** às a h-aire.
>
> Dh’fhalbh i **astar fada** tro thìr fhàsail.
>
> Sheinn i **crònan milis binn** dha.

When an adjective or genitive noun modifies a *nominative plural* noun which doesn't end with a slender consonant, it is never lenited.

> Nuair a bha an saoghal òg bha **daoine treuna** ann.

When an adjective or genitive noun modifies a *dative plural* noun which doesn't end with a slender consonant, it is never lenited.

> Bha eagal air a mhathair gun tigeadh naimhdean ’athar air tòir an leinibh, agus mar sin chuir i e a-mach do na **coilltean fàsail**.

When an adjective or genitive noun modifies a *dative masculine* noun which does not have the definite article as pre-specifier, it is never lenited.

> Nuair a bha Fionn ’na **leanabh beag**, mharbhadh ’athair.
>
> Bha aige ri an cumail ’nan **cròileagan cruinn** ann am badan àraidh, 

### Lenition

When an adjective or genitive noun modifies a *dative feminine* noun, it is lenited if possible.

> Dh’fhalbh i astar fada tro **thìr fhàsail**.

Not all consonants are (orthographically) lenitable, hence not all adjectives and nouns are (orthographically) lenitable.
