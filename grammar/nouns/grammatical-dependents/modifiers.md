## Relative clause particles as modifiers of nouns

A noun can have one of the relative clause particles as a modifier – `a`, `nach`, `far`, `anns (an)`, etc.

### The positive relative clause particle *a*

Both proper and common nouns can be modified by the positive relative clause particle `a`.

> ◊ Mharbhadh **Cumhal**, **a** bha ’na rìgh àraidh.
> 
> Is i siud a’ chiad **shealg a** rinn Fionn.

In the first example, the nominative masculine proper noun `Cumhal` is modified by the particle `a` (which itself has the verb `bha` as its complement) – `Cumhal, a bha ’na rìgh àraidh` ‘Cumhal, who was an exceptional king’

In the second example, the nominative feminine common noun `shealg` ‘a hunt’ is similarly modified by the particle `a` (which here takes the verb `rinn` ‘did’ as its complement) – `a’ chiad shealg a rinn Fionn` ‘the first hunt that Finn did’.

### The negative relative clause particle *nach*

Similarly, both proper and common nouns can be modified by the negative relative clause particle `nach`.

> ◊ Mharbhadh **Cumhal**, **nach** robh ’na rìgh àraidh.
>
> ◊ Is e siud am **balach** **nach** deach a-mach don achadh.

In the first example, the nominative masculine proper noun `Cumhal` is modified by the particle `nach` (which itself has the verb `robh` ‘was’ as its complement) – `Cumhal, nach robh ’na rìgh àraidh` ‘Cumhal, who was not an exceptional king’

In the second example, the nominative masculine common noun `balach` ‘boy’ is similarly modified by the particle `a` (which here takes the verb `deach` ‘went’ as its complement) – `am balach nach deach a-mach don achadh` ‘the boy who did not go out to the field’.

### The locative relative clause particle *far*

The locative relative clause particle `far` ‘where’ can also be used to modify both common and proper nouns (specifically those denoting places).

> Rachadh e a-mach don **achadh** **far** an robh gearrain gu leòr a’ ruith bho chnoc gu cnoc.
>
> ◊ Bha Fionn ann an **Glaschu**, **far** an do mharbhadh ’athair.

In the first example, the dative masculine common noun `achadh` ‘field’ is modified by the particle `far` (which takes as its complement the positive interrogative verb particle `an`) – `an t-achadh far an robh gearrain a’ ruith` ‘the field where hares were running’.

In the second example, it is the proper noun `Glaschu` ‘Glasgow’ which is modified by `far` – `Glaschu, far an do mharbhadh ’athair` ‘Glasgow, where his father was killed’.

### Prepositional relative clause particles

Both proper nouns and common nouns can also be modified by prepositional relative clause particles.

> ◊ Mharbhadh **Cumhall**, **aig** an robh dithis bhan.
>
> Nuair a bha an saoghal òg bha **daoine** treuna ann, **ris** an canadh iad an Fhiann.

In the first example here, the nominative masculine proper noun `Cumhall` is modified by the prepositional relative `aig` – `Cumhall, aig an robh dithis bhan` ‘Cumhall, who had two wives’.

In the second example here, the nominative plural common noun `daoine` ‘men’ is modified by the prepositional relative clause particle `ris` – `na daoine ris an canadh iad an Fhiann` ‘the men against whom they would say the Fenians (ie. the men whom they would call the Fenians)’.

## Lenition of noun modifiers

Prepositions and relative clause particles are grammatical function words, and hence are not lenitable.

However, many adjectives and genitive common nouns *are* lenitable, and those which modify nouns may or may not lenite depending (mainly) on the gender and case of the noun they modify.

### No lenition

When an adjective or genitive noun modifies a *nominative masculine* noun, it is never lenited.

> Cha do leig i **Fionn beag** às a h-aire.
>
> Dh’fhalbh i **astar fada** tro thìr fhàsail.
>
> Sheinn i **crònan milis binn** dha.

When an adjective or genitive noun modifies a *nominative plural* noun which doesn't end with a slender consonant, it is never lenited.

> Nuair a bha an saoghal òg bha **daoine treuna** ann.

When an adjective or genitive noun modifies a *dative plural* noun which doesn't end with a slender consonant, it is never lenited.

> Bha eagal air a mhathair gun tigeadh naimhdean ’athar air tòir an leinibh, agus mar sin chuir i e a-mach do na **coilltean fàsail**.

When an adjective or genitive noun modifies a *dative masculine* noun which does not have the definite article as pre-specifier, it is never lenited.

> Nuair a bha Fionn ’na **leanabh beag**, mharbhadh ’athair.
>
> Bha aige ri an cumail ’nan **cròileagan cruinn** ann am badan àraidh, 

### Lenition

When an adjective or genitive noun modifies a *dative feminine* noun, it is lenited if possible.

> Dh’fhalbh i astar fada tro **thìr fhàsail**.

Not all consonants are (orthographically) lenitable, hence not all adjectives and nouns are (orthographically) lenitable.
