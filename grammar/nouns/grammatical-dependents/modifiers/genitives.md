## Genitive common nouns as modifiers of other nouns

A noun can have a genitive common noun modifier.

*Common nouns* can be modified by *non-plural* (feminine or masculine) genitive common nouns.

> Fhuair i e ’na **shuain chadail**, agus thog i e ’na làmhan gu sèimh socrach, agus phòg i e.

In this example, the dative feminine common noun `shuain` ‘slumber’ is modified by the masculine genitive common noun `chadail` ‘sleep’ – `shuain chadail` ‘slumber of sleep, sleepy slumber’.

Common nouns can also be modified by *plural* genitive common nouns.

> Bha an **dithis bhan** ud a’ toirt an aire air gus an do dh’fhàs e suas.

The nominative feminine common noun `dithis` ‘a group of two people’ is modified by the plural genitive common noun `bhan` ‘women’ – `dithis bhan` ‘a group of two women, a female pair’.

We will postpone, for now, the question of whether *proper nouns* can also be modified by (singular or plural) genitive common nouns.
