# Genitive common nouns as modifiers of other nouns

A noun can have a genitive common noun modifier.

For example, a *common noun* can be modified by a *non-plural* (feminine or masculine) genitive common noun.

> `Fhuair i e ’na shuain chadail.` ‘She found him in sleepy slumber.’

In this example, the dative feminine common noun `shuain` ‘slumber’ is modified by the masculine genitive common noun `chadail` ‘sleep’.

Common nouns can also be modified by *plural* genitive common nouns.

> `Bha an dithis bhan ud a’ toirt an aire air gus an do dh’fhàs e suas.` ‘Those two women were looking after him until he grew up.’

Here, the nominative feminine common noun `dithis` ‘a group of two people’ is modified by the plural genitive common noun `bhan` ‘women’ – `dithis bhan` ‘a group of two women, a womanly group of two people’.

We will postpone, for now, the question of whether a *proper nouns* can be modified by (singular or plural) genitive common noun.
