# Adjectives as modifiers of nouns

A noun can have one or more adjective modifiers.

### Proper nouns

Proper nouns can be modified by adjectives:

> `Cha do leig i Fionn beag as a h-aire.` ‘She did not let little Finn out of her attention.’

In this example, the nominative masculine proper noun `Fionn` is modified by the adjective `beag` ‘little’.

### Common nouns

Common nouns can be modified by adjectives too:

> `Bha daoine treuna ann, ris an canadh iad an Fhiann.` ‘There were brave men, who they called the Fenians.’
> 
> `Nuair a bha Fionn ’na leanabh beag, mharbhadh ’athair.` ‘When Finn was a little infant, his father was killed.’
> 
> `Sheinn i crònan milis binn dha.` ‘She sang a sweet melodious tune to him.’

In the first example, the nominative plural common noun `daoine` ‘men’ is modified by the adjective `treuna` ‘brave’. 

In the second example, the dative masculine common noun `leanabh` is modified by the adjective `beag` ‘little’. 

In the third example, the nominative masculine common noun `crònan` ‘tune’ has *two* adjective modifiers – `milis` ‘sweet’ and `binn` ‘melodious’.
