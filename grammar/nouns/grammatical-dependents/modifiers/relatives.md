# Relative clause particles as modifiers of nouns

A noun can have one of the relative clause particles as a modifier – `a`, `nach`, `far`, `anns (an)`, etc.

### The positive relative clause particle *a*

Both proper and common nouns can be modified by the positive relative clause particle `a`.

> ◊ Mharbhadh **Cumhal**, **a** bha ’na rìgh àraidh.
> 
> Is i siud a’ chiad **shealg a** rinn Fionn.

In the first example, the nominative masculine proper noun `Cumhal` is modified by the particle `a` (which itself has the verb `bha` as its complement) – `Cumhal, a bha ’na rìgh àraidh` ‘Cumhal, who was an exceptional king’

In the second example, the nominative feminine common noun `shealg` ‘a hunt’ is similarly modified by the particle `a` (which here takes the verb `rinn` ‘did’ as its complement) – `a’ chiad shealg a rinn Fionn` ‘the first hunt that Finn did’.

### The negative relative clause particle *nach*

Similarly, both proper and common nouns can be modified by the negative relative clause particle `nach`.

> ◊ Mharbhadh **Cumhal**, **nach** robh ’na rìgh àraidh.
>
> ◊ Is e siud am **balach** **nach** deach a-mach don achadh.

In the first example, the nominative masculine proper noun `Cumhal` is modified by the particle `nach` (which itself has the verb `robh` ‘was’ as its complement) – `Cumhal, nach robh ’na rìgh àraidh` ‘Cumhal, who was not an exceptional king’

In the second example, the nominative masculine common noun `balach` ‘boy’ is similarly modified by the particle `a` (which here takes the verb `deach` ‘went’ as its complement) – `am balach nach deach a-mach don achadh` ‘the boy who did not go out to the field’.

### The locative relative clause particle *far*

The locative relative clause particle `far` ‘where’ can also be used to modify both common and proper nouns (specifically those denoting places).

> Rachadh e a-mach don **achadh** **far** an robh gearrain gu leòr a’ ruith bho chnoc gu cnoc.
>
> ◊ Bha Fionn ann an **Glaschu**, **far** an do mharbhadh ’athair.

In the first example, the dative masculine common noun `achadh` ‘field’ is modified by the particle `far` (which takes as its complement the positive interrogative verb particle `an`) – `an t-achadh far an robh gearrain a’ ruith` ‘the field where hares were running’.

In the second example, it is the proper noun `Glaschu` ‘Glasgow’ which is modified by `far` – `Glaschu, far an do mharbhadh ’athair` ‘Glasgow, where his father was killed’.

### Prepositional relative clause particles

Both proper nouns and common nouns can also be modified by prepositional relative clause particles.

> ◊ Mharbhadh **Cumhall**, **aig** an robh dithis bhan.
>
> Nuair a bha an saoghal òg bha **daoine** treuna ann, **ris** an canadh iad an Fhiann.

In the first example here, the nominative masculine proper noun `Cumhall` is modified by the prepositional relative `aig` – `Cumhall, aig an robh dithis bhan` ‘Cumhall, who had two wives’.

In the second example here, the nominative plural common noun `daoine` ‘men’ is modified by the prepositional relative clause particle `ris` – `na daoine ris an canadh iad an Fhiann` ‘the men against whom they would say the Fenians (ie. the men whom they would call the Fenians)’.

Notes:

- Unless otherwise specified, examples are adapted from the story *[Fionn](../../texts/Fionn.md)*, in Lachlann MacFhionghuin’s (c.1950) *Leabhraichean Leughaidh: Leabhar II* (pp. 81–85).
- Strictly speaking, it is the relative clause particle itself which is the grammatical modifier of the noun in these examples, and not the whole relative clause. Grammatical relations, as we understand them, are between individual words and not between words and phrases.
