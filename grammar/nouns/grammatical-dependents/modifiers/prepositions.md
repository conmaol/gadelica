# Prepositions as modifiers of nouns

A noun can have one or more prepositions as modifiers.

For example, *common nouns* can be modified by prepositions (which themselves take other nouns as their complements):

> `B’ e Cumhal a b’ ainm air aon de na daoine seo.` ‘It was Cumhal that was the nome of one of these men.’
>
> `Dh’fhalbh i astar fada tro thìr fhàsail.` ‘She set out for a long distance through desolate land.’
>
> `Bha gearrain gu leòr a’ ruith bho chnoc gu cnoc.` ‘Plenty of hares were running from hill to hill.’

In the first example, the nominative masculine common noun `ainm` ‘name’ is modified by the preposition `air` ‘on’. 

In the second example, the common noun `astar` ‘distance’ is modified by the preposition `tro` ‘through’.

In the third example, the nominative plural common noun `gearrain` ‘hares’ is modified by the preposition `gu` ‘to’ (which itself has the complement `leòr` ‘sufficiency’) – `gearrain gu leòr` ‘hares to sufficiency, enough hares’.

Prepositional pronouns can be modifiers of common nouns all on their own.

> `Thilg e urchair oirre, agus gheàrr sin na sgiathan aice.` ‘He threw a stone at her, and that cut her wings.’

Here, the nominative plural common noun `sgiathan` ‘wings’ is modified by the prepositional pronoun `aice` ‘at her’ – `na sgiathan aice` ‘the wings at her, her wings’.

Note also that the progressive particle `ag` counts as a preposition in this respect:

> `Chunnaic e lach a’ snàmh air loch.` ‘He saw a duck swimming on a lake.’

In this example, the nominative feminine common noun `lach` ‘duck’ is modified by the particle `a’` (a reduced form of `ag`).

*Proper nouns* can also be modified by prepositions.

> `Sin Cumhal à Glaschu.` ‘That is Cumhal from Glasgow.’

Here, the preposition `à` ‘from’ is a modifier of the proper noun `Cumhal`.

Notes:

- Unless otherwise specified, examples are adapted from the story *[Fionn](../../texts/Fionn.md)*, in Lachlann MacFhionghuin’s (c.1950) *Leabhraichean Leughaidh: Leabhar II* (pp. 81–85).
- Strictly speaking, it is the preposition itself which is the grammatical modifier of the noun in these examples, and not the whole prepositional phrase. Grammatical relations, as we understand them, are between individual words and not between words and phrases.
