# Prepositions as modifiers of nouns

## Prepositions as modifiers of nouns

A noun can have one or more prepositions as modifiers.

*Common nouns* can be modified by prepositions (which themselves take other nouns as their complements).

> B’ e Cumhal a b’ **ainm air** aon de na daoine seo, agus bha mac aige air an robh Fionn.
>
> Dh’fhalbh i **astar** fada **tro** thìr fhàsail gus an do lorg i an t-àite anns an robh an leanabh.
>
> Rachadh e a-mach don achadh far an robh **gearrain gu** leòr a’ ruith bho chnoc gu cnoc.

In the first example, the nominative masculine common noun `ainm` ‘name’ is modified by the preposition `air` ‘on’ (which itself has the complement `aon` ‘one’) – `ainm air aon de na daoine seo` ‘a name on (of) one of these men’. In the second example, the common noun `astar` ‘distance’ is modified by the preposition `tro` ‘through’ – `astar fada tro thìr fhàsail` ‘a long distance through desolate land’.

In the third example, the nominative plural common noun `gearrain` ‘hares’ is modified by the preposition `gu` ‘to’ (which itself has the complement `leòr` ‘sufficiency’) – `gearrain gu leòr` ‘hares to sufficiency, enough hares’.

Prepositional pronouns can be modifiers of common nouns all on their own.

> Thilg e urchair oirre, agus gheàrr sin na **sgiathan aice**.

Here, the nominative plural common noun `sgiathan` ‘wings’ is modified by the prepositional pronoun `aice` ‘at her’ – `sgiathan aice` ‘wings at her, her wings’.

Also, the progressive particle `ag` counts as a preposition in this respect.

> Latha de na làithean chaidh e mach agus chunnaic e **lach a’** snàmh air loch.

In this example, the nominative feminine common noun `lach` ‘duck’ is modified by the particle `a’` (which itself takes the dative noun `snàmh` ‘swimming’ as its complement) – `lach a’ snàmh air loch` ‘a duck swimming in a lake’.

*Proper nouns* can also be modified by prepositions.

> ◊ Mharbhadh **Cumhall à** Glaschu.

Here, the preposition `à` ‘from’ is a modifier of the proper noun `Cumhall` – `Cumhall à Glaschu` ‘Cumhall from Glasgow’.

Notes:
  
- Strictly speaking, it is the preposition itself which is the grammatical modifier of the noun in these examples, and not the whole prepositional phrase. Grammatical relations, as we understand them, are between individual words and not between words and phrases.
