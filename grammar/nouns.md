# Nouns

## Semantic characterisation

Nouns are words that typically denote *material* entities – things, substances, aggregates and groups which are literally *made of matter* (atoms, molecules, etc.). Every word that denotes a material entity is a noun, though not every noun denotes a material entity. Nouns which denote material entities are known as *concrete* nouns, and nouns which denote non-material entities are known as *abstract* nouns. 

In the following short text (from Lachlann MacFhionghuin *Leabhraichean Leughaidh* Vol.II td.81) the nouns are all underlined –

> An <ins>uair</ins> a bha an <ins>saoghal</ins> òg bha <ins>daoine</ins> treuna ann, ris an canadh iad an <ins>Fhiann</ins>. B’ e <ins>Cumhal</ins> a b’ <ins>ainm</ins> air aon de na <ins>daoine</ins> so, agus bha <ins>mac</ins> aige air an robh <ins>Fionn</ins>.
> An <ins>uair</ins> a bha <ins>Fionn</ins> ’n a <ins>leanabh</ins> beag, mharbhadh <ins>athair</ins> ann an aon de na <ins>blàraibh</ins> a chuir an <ins>Fhiann</ins> ’nam <ins>measg</ins> fhéin. Bha <ins>eagal</ins> air a <ins>mhathair</ins> gun tigeadh <ins>naimhdean</ins> <ins>athar</ins> air <ins>tòir</ins> an <ins>leinibh</ins>, agus mar sin chuir i e a mach do na <ins>coilltean</ins> fàsail air <ins>chùram</ins> <ins>dithis</ins> <ins>mhnathan</ins> eòlach. 

The concrete nouns in this passage are –
- material things – saoghal ‘world’, Cumhal ‘Cumhal’, mac ‘son’, Fionn ‘Finn’, leanabh / leinibh ‘infant’, atha[i]r ‘father’, m[h]athair ‘mother’
- material aggregates – daoine ‘men’, F[h]iann ‘Fianna’, naimhdean ‘enemies’
- coilltean ‘woods’
- dithis ‘two people’
- m[h]nathan ‘women’

Notes:
- ‘material’ here literally means ‘made of matter’ (atoms, molecules, crystals, etc.). Material entities are visible and tangible.
- arguably, pronouns can also denote material entities
- Lamb (2024:37): “Nouns are a time-stable class denoting entities, places and objects, as well as concepts that have similar grammatical behaviour.” *ubhal* ‘apple’, *nighean* ‘girl’, *clann* ‘children’, *Dòmhnall* ‘Donald’, *Glaschu* ‘Glasgow’, *beachd* ‘opinion’, *astar* ‘distance’

There are two main kinds of noun –
- **proper nouns** are names, denoting particular entities
- **common nouns** denote classes of entity


Pronouns? Lamb (2024:38): “Pronouns are short words that stand in for noun phrases.”

## Grammatical categories

Nouns have **gender** – every noun is either **feminine** or **masculine** or **plural**.

Nouns have **case** – every noun is either **nominative** or **dative** or **genitive**.

Notes:
- Lamb (2024:37): “In Gaelic, most nouns [...] can inflect for case and number. Gaelic nouns are grammatically gendered; they are inherently either masculine or feminine.”
- dual number/gender? vocative case? 

## Dependents

Lamb (2024:37): “In Gaelic, most nouns can be preceded by a determiner, such as the definite article (‘the’), [...]. [...] As the head of a noun phrase, nouns maye be modified by adjectives, with which they share several properties. Adjectives modify a noun within a noun phrase or provide additional information about it, such as serving to restrict possible reference.”

Lamb (2024:38): “Determiners are added to a noun phrase to restrict or specify its reference. [...] Demonstratives [...] are used to mark a noun’s position or prominence. [...] [C]ardinal numerals [...] state the count of the nouns in discussion and ordinal numerals [...] state the position of the noun in a sequence [...]. [...] Prepositions indicate relationships between nouns, [...].”

## Functions

Lamb (2024:37): “The main function of a noun is to act as a verbal argument.”

Lamb (2024:38): “Determiners are added to a noun phrase to restrict or specify its reference. [...] Demonstratives [...] are used to mark a noun’s position or prominence. [...] [C]ardinal numerals [...] state the count of the nouns in discussion and ordinal numerals [...] state the position of the noun in a sequence [...]. [...] Prepositions indicate relationships between nouns, as well as between nouns and verbs.”
