### Concrete nouns and abstract nouns

Nouns are words that typically denote *material* entities.

Material entities are those individuals, substances, aggregates and groups which are literally *made of matter*, consisting of atoms, organised into molecules, crystals, and so on. 

Every word that denotes a material entity is a noun (or a [pronoun](pronouns.md)). 

However, not every noun denotes a material entity. Some nouns denote *non-material* entities, which are not made out of matter. Non-material entities include spaces (places and paths) and situations (states, processes, events and actions).

Nouns that denote material entities are known as *concrete* nouns, and nouns that denote non-material entities are known as *abstract* nouns. 

The following passage is adapted from Lachlann MacFhionghuin’s (c.1950) *Leabhraichean Leughaidh: Leabhar II* (p.81). All and only the nouns have been highlighted.

> Nuair a bha an **saoghal** òg bha **daoine** treuna ann, ris an canadh iad an **Fhiann**.
>
> B’ e **Cumhal** a b’ **ainm** air aon de na **daoine** seo, agus bha **mac** aige air an robh **Fionn**.
>
> Nuair a bha **Fionn** ’na **leanabh** beag, mharbhadh ’**athair** ann an aon de na **blàraibh** a chuir an **Fhiann** ’nam **measg** fhéin.
>
> Bha **eagal** air a **mhàthair** gun tigeadh **naimhdean** ’**athar** air **tòir** an **leinibh**, agus mar sin chuir i e a-mach do na **coilltean** fàsail air **chùram** **dithis** **bhan** eòlach. 

The concrete nouns in this passage are
*saoghal* ‘a world’,
*daoine* ‘men’,
*Fhiann* ‘warriors’,
*Cumhall* ‘Cumhall’,
*mac* ‘a son’,
*Fionn* ‘Finn’,
*leanabh* (*leinibh*) ‘an infant’,
*athair* (*athar*) ‘a father’,
*mhàthair* ‘a mother’,
*naimhdean* ‘enemies’,
*coilltean* ‘forests’,
*dithis* ‘a group of two people’ and
*bhan* ‘women’.

The abstract nouns in the passage are 
*ainm* ‘a name’,
*blàraibh* ‘battles’,
*measg* ‘midst’,
*eagal* ‘fear’,
*tòir* ‘a pursuit’ and
*chùram* ‘care’.

Notes:

- Some readers might be uncomfortable seeing words like *measg*, *tòir* and perhaps even *chùram* classified as (abstract) nouns in the above, preferring to think of them as parts of (complex) *prepositions* rather than words in and of themselves. This is a false binary – *measg*, *tòir* and *chùram* are *both* components of (lexicalised) prepositional compounds *and* (perhaps fossilised) nouns.
  
- The (concrete) noun *dithis* ‘a group of two people’ is most accurately classified as a (concrete) noun with numeric meaning, rather than as a numeral *per se*.

- Nouns have been defined in broadly similar terms by other grammarians of Gaelic:
  > Nouns are a time-stable class denoting entities, places and objects, as well as concepts that have similar grammatical behaviour. Examples of nouns are *ubhal* ‘apple’, *nighean* ‘girl’, *clann* ‘children’, *beachd* ‘opinion’, *astar* ‘distance’, *Dòmhnall* ‘Donald’ and *Glaschu* ‘Glasgow’. (Lamb 2024: 37)
  > 
  > Tha ainmear ’na ainm air duine no air nì, m.e. *boireannach*; *balach*; *bòrd*; *doras*. (Cox 2017: §55)
  >
  > Ainmear eas-cruthach, a tha ’na ainm air rudeigin nach cluinn, nach fhaic, agus ris nach bean duine, m.e. *an fhìrinn*; *an t-slàinte*; *am bàs*; *a’ bheatha*; *a’ chogais* 7c – seach *bòrd*; *doras* 7c a tha ’na ainmearan cruthach. (Cox 2017: §56(v))

### Proper nouns and common nouns

Nouns can be further classified according to the nature of their denotation, or the way in which they relate to entities in the world.

*Proper nouns* are names of particular entities

*Common nouns* denote classes of entity

In the passage from the previous section, there are two proper nouns – *Cumhal* ‘Cumhall’ and *Fionn* ‘Finn’. 

All the other nouns in the passage, whether concrete or abstract, are common nouns – 
*saoghal* ‘a world’,
*daoine* ‘men’,
*Fhiann* ‘warriors’,
*ainm* ‘a name’,
*mac* ‘a son’,
*leanabh* (*leinibh*) ‘an infant’,
*athair* (*athar*) ‘a father’,
*blàraibh* ‘battles’,
*measg* ‘midst’,
*eagal* ‘fear’,
*mhàthair* ‘a mother’,
*naimhdean* ‘enemies’,
*tòir* ‘a pursuit’,
*coilltean* ‘forests’,
*chùram* ‘care’.
*dithis* ‘a group of two people’, and
*bhan* ‘women’.

Notes:

- Proper nouns are always capitalised in writing, even when they do not occur as the first word in a sentence. However, not all capitalised nouns in the middle of a sentence are proper nouns. For example, *Fhiann* ‘warriors’ in the passage above is correctly classified as a common noun. It is capitalised in the text because it is the core element (the ‘head’) of a phrase, *an Fhiann* ‘the Warriors’, which is being presented as the name of a particular group of men (cf. ‘the Fenians’). Moreover, even though *an Fhiann* is a name, it would be incorrect to characterise it as a proper noun, since it is not a noun.
  
- The dimensions of concrete vs. abstract and proper vs. common are not truly orthogonal. It seems that all proper nouns are concrete, and hence that all abstract nouns are common.

- The distinction between proper and common nouns is familiar from the work of other grammarians of Gaelic (even if they typically confuse proper nouns with names in general):
  
  >  Gaelic has two broad noun categories: common nouns and proper nouns. Common nouns are the physical and abstract entities that we discuss regularly in language, such as ‘bird’, ‘mountain’ or ‘philosophy’. Proper nouns are those items that we normally capitalise in writing, such as persons (‘Donald’) and places (‘Cape Breton’).” (Lamb 2024: 46)
  > 
  > Tha diofar sheòrsaichean ainmearan ann: (i) Ainmear cumanta, a tha na ainm air rudeigin bitheanta, m.e. *boireannach*; *cat*; *bròg*; *sùil*; *aran*; *taigh*. (ii) Ainmear sònraichte, a tha na ainm air duine, air àite no air rudeigin àraidh, m.e. *Mòrag*; *Seumas*; *Glaschu*; *BBC ALBA*; *an Gearasdan*. (iii) [...] (Cox 2017: §56)
  >
  > *noun*: the name of a thing or concept (e.g. “train”, “beauty”) or of a person or place (i.e. proper nouns, e.g. “Dr Who”, “Italy”). (Byrne 2002: 15)
  
- Note that Cox (2017: §56) lists five other classes of noun in addition to common and proper nouns – collective nouns (*ainmear trusaidh* eg. *clann*, *muinntir*, *òigridh*, *crodh*, *dream*, *eunlaith*, *gràisg*); quantity nouns (*ainmear meud* eg. *falt*, *feur*, *bainne*, *uisge*, *gainmheach*); abstract nouns (*ainmear eas-cruthach* – see above); compound nouns (*ainmear fillte* eg. *taigh-beag*, *cailleach-dhubh*, *trom-laighe*); and verbal nouns (*ainmear gnìomhaireach* eg. *dèanamh*, *iarraidh*, *ithe*, *tuigsinn*, *bruidhinn*). For present purposes, and with the obvious exception of his ‘compound nouns’ (many of which are not even nouns at all), these are best understood as semantic sub-classes of common noun.

## Grammatical categories of nouns

- Feminine nouns, masculine nouns and plural nouns
- [Nominative nouns, dative nouns and genitive nouns](#nominative-nouns-dative-nouns-and-genitive-nouns)

### Feminine nouns, masculine nouns and plural nouns

Nouns in Gaelic have *gender* – every noun is either **feminine** or **masculine** or **plural**.

Recall the example passage from the previous section, reproduced below for convenience.

> Nuair a bha an <mark title="masculine, common, concrete: ‘a world’">saoghal</mark> òg bha <mark title="plural, common, concrete: ‘men’">daoine</mark> treuna ann, ris an canadh iad an <mark title="feminine, common, concrete: ‘warriors’">Fhiann</mark>.
>
> B’ e <mark title="masculine, proper, concrete: ‘Cumhal’">Cumhal</mark> a b’ <mark title="masculine, common, abstract: ‘a name’">ainm</mark> air aon de na <mark title="plural, common, concrete: ‘men’">daoine</mark> seo, agus bha <mark title="masculine, common, concrete: ‘a son’">mac</mark> aige air an robh <mark title="masculine, proper, concrete: ‘Finn’">Fionn</mark>.
>
> Nuair a bha <mark title="masculine, proper, concrete: ‘Finn’">Fionn</mark> ’na <mark title="masculine, common, concrete: ‘an infant’">leanabh</mark> beag, mharbhadh ’<mark title="masculine, common, concrete: ‘a father’">athair</mark> ann an aon de na <mark title="plural, common, abstract: ‘battles’">blàraibh</mark> a chuir an <mark title="feminine, common, concrete: ‘warriors’">Fhiann</mark> ’nam <mark title="masculine, common, abstract: ‘midst’">measg</mark> fhéin.
>
> Bha <mark title="masculine, common, abstract: ‘fear’">eagal</mark> air a <mark title="feminine, common, concrete: ‘a mother’">mhathair</mark> gun tigeadh <mark title="plural, common, concrete: ‘enemies’">naimhdean</mark> ’<mark title="masculine, common, concrete: ‘a father’">athar</mark> air <mark title="feminine, common, abstract: ‘a pursuit’">tòir</mark> an <mark title="masculine, common, concrete: ‘an infant’">leinibh</mark>, agus mar sin chuir i e a-mach do na <mark title="plural, common, concrete: ‘forests’">coilltean</mark> fàsail air <mark title="masculine, common, abstract: ‘care’">chùram</mark> <mark title="feminine, common, concrete: ‘a group of two people’">dithis</mark> <mark title="plural, common, concrete: ‘women’">bhan</mark> eòlach. 

The feminine nouns in this passage are ***Fhiann*** ‘warriors’, ***mhàthair*** ‘a mother’, ***tòir*** ‘a pursuit’, and ***dithis*** ‘a group of two people’.

The plural nouns are ***daoine*** ‘men’, ***blàraibh*** ‘battles’, ***naimhdean*** ‘enemies’, ***coilltean*** ‘forests’, and ***bhan*** ‘women’.

All the other nouns in the passage, whether proper or common, are masculine nouns – ***saoghal*** ‘a world’, ***Cumhall*** ‘Cumhal’, ***ainm*** ‘a name’, ***mac*** ‘a son’, ***Fionn*** ‘Finn’, ***leanamh***/***leinibh*** ‘an infant’, ***athair***/***athar*** ‘a father’, ***measg*** ‘midst’, ***eagal*** ‘fear’, and ***chùram*** ‘care’.

Notes:
  
- Traditional descriptions of Gaelic grammar usually distinguish between the two, allegedly orthogonal, grammatical categories of *gender* (feminine or masculine) and *number* (singular or plural). However, these categories are clearly *not* orthogonal in modern Gaelic, since there is no gender distinction whatsoever in the plural – plural nouns derived from feminine singulars behave in exactly the same way as those derived from masculine singulars. Therefore, it seems clear that ‘plural number’ in modern Gaelic is more accurately treated as a third (non-sex-based) grammatical gender.
  
- It is an exaggeration to claim that modern Gaelic has a third grammatical number – the ‘dual’. The relevant phenomena are more realistically explained as involving a handful of legacy inflectional peculiarities conditioned by the cardinal numeral ***dà*** ‘two’.

- Gender (in the sense assumed here) is only partially orthogonal to the distinction between proper and common nouns. While proper nouns can be either feminine or masculine, there appear to be no grammatically plural proper nouns. However, common nouns can be either feminine or masculine or plural.

- Some definitions from other grammarians of Gaelic:

  > In Gaelic, [nouns] can inflect for case and number. Gaelic nouns are grammatically gendered; they are inherently either masculine or feminine. (Lamb 2024: 37)
  > 
  > Faodaidh ainmearan a bhith aon chuid fireann no boireann; aon chuid singilte, deise no iolra. (Cox 2017: §55)

### Nominative nouns, dative nouns and genitive nouns

Nouns in Gaelic have *case* – every noun is either **nominative** or **dative** or **genitive**.

In the passage from the previous section, the dative nouns are ***daoine*** ‘men’ (the second occurence), ***leanabh*** ‘an infant’, ***blàraibh*** ‘battles’, ***measg*** ‘midst’, ***mhàthair*** ‘a mother’, ***tòir*** ‘a pursuit’, ***coilltean*** ‘forests’, and ***chùram*** ‘care’.

The genitive nouns are ***athar*** ‘a father’, ***leinibh*** ‘an infant’, ***dithis*** ‘a group of two people’, and ***bhan*** ‘women’.  

All the other nouns in the passage are nominative nouns – ***saoghal*** ‘a world’, ***daoine*** ‘men’ (the first occurence), ***Fhiann*** ‘warriors’ (both occurences), ***Cumhal*** ‘Cumhal’, ***ainm*** ‘a name’, ***mac*** ‘a son’, ***Fionn*** ‘Finn’ (both occurences), ***athair*** ‘a father’, ***eagal*** ‘fear’, and ***naimhdean*** ‘enemies’.

Notes:

- Traditional descriptions of Gaelic grammar commonly mention the ‘vocative’ as a fourth case. However, the vocative is not strictly speaking a grammatical case since it does not mark a syntactic relation between the noun and another verb, preposition, adjective or noun in the same sentence. For this reason, we will treat the vocative as a handful of inflectional idiosyncracies conditioned by the vocative particle ***a***.

- Case is fully orthogonal to the other noun categories discussed thus far – proper vs. common nouns, and feminine vs. masculine vs. plural nouns.

- Some other definitions of case:
  
  > Faodaidh ainmearan a bhith [...] bunasach, ginideach, tabhartach no gairmeach. (Cox 2017: §55)
