# Nouns

## Semantic characterisation

Nouns are words that typically denote *material* entities – things, substances, aggregates and groups which are literally *made of matter* (atoms, molecules, etc.). Every word that denotes a material entity is a noun, though not every noun denotes a material entity. Nouns which denote material entities are known as *concrete* nouns, and nouns which denote non-material entities are known as *abstract* nouns. 

Take the following short text –

> An uair a bha an saoghal òg bha daoine treuna ann, ris an canadh iad an Fhiann. B’ e Cumhal a b’ ainm air aon de na daoine so, agus bha mac aige air an robh Fionn.
> An uair a bha Fionn ’n a leanabh beag, mharbhadh athair ann an aon de na blàraibh a chuir an Fhiann ’nam measg fhéin. Bha eagal air a mhathair gun tigeadh naimhdean athar air tòir an leinibh, agus mar sin chuir i e a mach do na coilltean fàsail air chùram dithis mhnathan eòlach. 


Here are some examples of concrete nouns:
- *ubhal* ‘apple’, *nighean* ‘girl’, *clann* ‘children’, *Dòmhnall* ‘Donald’, *Glaschu* ‘Glasgow’

And here are some examples of abstract nouns:
- *beachd* ‘opinion’, *astar* ‘distance’

Notes:
- ‘material’ here literally means ‘made of matter’ (atoms, molecules, crystals, etc.). Material entities are visible and tangible.
- arguably, pronouns can also denote material entities
- Lamb (2024:37): “Nouns are a time-stable class denoting entities, places and objects, as well as concepts that have similar grammatical behaviour.”

There are two main kinds of noun –
- **proper nouns** are names, denoting particular entities
- **common nouns** denote classes of entity


Pronouns? Lamb (2024:38): “Pronouns are short words that stand in for noun phrases.”

## Grammatical categories

Nouns have **gender** – every noun is either **feminine** or **masculine** or **plural**.

Nouns have **case** – every noun is either **nominative** or **dative** or **genitive**.

Notes:
- Lamb (2024:37): “In Gaelic, most nouns [...] can inflect for case and number. Gaelic nouns are grammatically gendered; they are inherently either masculine or feminine.”
- dual number/gender? vocative case? 

## Dependents

Lamb (2024:37): “In Gaelic, most nouns can be preceded by a determiner, such as the definite article (‘the’), [...]. [...] As the head of a noun phrase, nouns maye be modified by adjectives, with which they share several properties. Adjectives modify a noun within a noun phrase or provide additional information about it, such as serving to restrict possible reference.”

Lamb (2024:38): “Determiners are added to a noun phrase to restrict or specify its reference. [...] Demonstratives [...] are used to mark a noun’s position or prominence. [...] [C]ardinal numerals [...] state the count of the nouns in discussion and ordinal numerals [...] state the position of the noun in a sequence [...]. [...] Prepositions indicate relationships between nouns, [...].”

## Functions

Lamb (2024:37): “The main function of a noun is to act as a verbal argument.”

Lamb (2024:38): “Determiners are added to a noun phrase to restrict or specify its reference. [...] Demonstratives [...] are used to mark a noun’s position or prominence. [...] [C]ardinal numerals [...] state the count of the nouns in discussion and ordinal numerals [...] state the position of the noun in a sequence [...]. [...] Prepositions indicate relationships between nouns, as well as between nouns and verbs.”
