### Concrete nouns and abstract nouns

Nouns are words that typically denote *material* entities.

Material entities are those individuals, substances, aggregates and groups which are literally *made of matter* – atoms organised into molecules and crystals etc. 

Every word that denotes a material entity is a noun (or a [pronoun](pronouns.md)). 

However, not every noun denotes a material entity. Some nouns denote *non-material* entities, which are not made out of matter. Non-material entities include spaces (places and paths) and situations (states, processes, events and actions).

Nouns that denote material entities are known as *concrete* nouns, and nouns that denote non-material entities are known as *abstract* nouns. 

The following passage is adapted from the story *[Fionn](Fionn.md)* in Lachlann MacFhionghuin’s (c.1950) *Leabhraichean Leughaidh: Leabhar II* (p.81). All and only the nouns have been highlighted.

> Nuair a bha an **saoghal** òg bha **daoine** treuna ann, ris an canadh iad an **Fhiann**.
>
> B’ e **Cumhal** a b’ **ainm** air aon de na **daoine** seo, agus bha **mac** aige air an robh **Fionn**.
>
> Nuair a bha **Fionn** ’na **leanabh** beag, mharbhadh ’**athair** ann an aon de na **blàraibh** a chuir an **Fhiann** ’nam **measg** fhéin.
>
> Bha **eagal** air a **mhàthair** gun tigeadh **naimhdean** ’**athar** air **tòir** an **leinibh**, agus mar sin chuir i e a-mach do na **coilltean** fàsail air **chùram** **dithis** **bhan** eòlach. 

The concrete nouns in this passage are
`saoghal` ‘a world’,
`daoine` ‘men’,
`Fhiann` ‘warriors’,
`Cumhall` ‘Cumhall’,
`mac` ‘a son’,
`Fionn` ‘Finn’,
`leanabh / leinibh` ‘an infant’,
`athair / athar` ‘a father’,
`mhàthair` ‘a mother’,
`naimhdean` ‘enemies’,
`coilltean` ‘forests’,
`dithis` ‘a group of two people’ and
`bhan` ‘women’.

The abstract nouns in the passage are 
`ainm` ‘a name’,
`blàraibh` ‘battles’,
`measg` ‘midst’,
`eagal` ‘fear’,
`tòir` ‘a pursuit’ and
`chùram` ‘care’.

Notes:

- Some readers might be uncomfortable seeing words like `measg`, `tòir` and perhaps even `chùram` classified as (abstract) nouns here, preferring to think of them as being parts of (complex) *prepositions* rather than words in and of themselves. However, this is a false binary – `measg`, `tòir` and `chùram` are *both* components of (lexicalised) prepositional compounds *and* (perhaps fossilised) nouns.
  
- The (concrete) noun `dithis` ‘a group of two people’ is most accurately classified as a (concrete) noun with numeric meaning, rather than as a numeral *per se*.

- Nouns have been defined in broadly similar terms by other grammarians of Gaelic:
  > Nouns are a time-stable class denoting entities, places and objects, as well as concepts that have similar grammatical behaviour. Examples of nouns are *ubhal* ‘apple’, *nighean* ‘girl’, *clann* ‘children’, *beachd* ‘opinion’, *astar* ‘distance’, *Dòmhnall* ‘Donald’ and *Glaschu* ‘Glasgow’. (Lamb 2024: 37)
  > 
  > Tha ainmear ’na ainm air duine no air nì, m.e. *boireannach*; *balach*; *bòrd*; *doras*. (Cox 2017: §55)
  >
  > Ainmear eas-cruthach, a tha ’na ainm air rudeigin nach cluinn, nach fhaic, agus ris nach bean duine, m.e. *an fhìrinn*; *an t-slàinte*; *am bàs*; *a’ bheatha*; *a’ chogais* 7c – seach *bòrd*; *doras* 7c a tha ’na ainmearan cruthach. (Cox 2017: §56(v))

### Proper nouns and common nouns

Alongside the distinction between concrete and abstract nouns, nouns can be further sub-classified according to the nature of their denotation, or the way in which they relate to entities in the world.

*Proper nouns* are names of particular entities

*Common nouns* denote classes of entity

In the ‘Fionn’ passage from the previous section, there are two proper nouns – `Cumhal` ‘Cumhall’ and `Fionn` ‘Finn’. 

All the other nouns in the passage, whether concrete or abstract, are common nouns – 
`saoghal` ‘a world’,
`daoine` ‘men’,
`Fhiann` ‘warriors’,
`ainm` ‘a name’,
`mac` ‘a son’,
`leanabh / leinibh` ‘an infant’,
`athair / athar` ‘a father’,
`blàraibh` ‘battles’,
`measg` ‘midst’,
`eagal` ‘fear’,
`mhàthair` ‘a mother’,
`naimhdean` ‘enemies’,
`tòir` ‘a pursuit’,
`coilltean` ‘forests’,
`chùram` ‘care’,
`dithis` ‘a group of two people’ and
`bhan` ‘women’.

Notes:

- Proper nouns are always capitalised in writing, even when they do not occur as the first word in a sentence. However, not all capitalised nouns in the middle of a sentence are proper nouns. For example, `Fhiann` ‘warriors’ in the passage above is correctly classified as a common noun. It is capitalised in the text because it is the core element (the ‘head’) of a phrase, `an Fhiann` ‘the Warriors’, which is being presented as the name of a particular group of men (cf. ‘the Fenians’). Moreover, even though `an Fhiann` is a name, it would be incorrect to characterise it as a proper noun, since it is not a noun.
  
- The dimensions of concrete vs. abstract and proper vs. common are not truly orthogonal. It seems that all proper nouns are concrete, and hence that all abstract nouns are common.

- The distinction between proper and common nouns is familiar from the work of other grammarians of Gaelic (even if they typically confuse proper nouns with names in general):
  
  >  Gaelic has two broad noun categories: common nouns and proper nouns. Common nouns are the physical and abstract entities that we discuss regularly in language, such as ‘bird’, ‘mountain’ or ‘philosophy’. Proper nouns are those items that we normally capitalise in writing, such as persons (‘Donald’) and places (‘Cape Breton’).” (Lamb 2024: 46)
  > 
  > Tha diofar sheòrsaichean ainmearan ann: (i) Ainmear cumanta, a tha na ainm air rudeigin bitheanta, m.e. *boireannach*; *cat*; *bròg*; *sùil*; *aran*; *taigh*. (ii) Ainmear sònraichte, a tha na ainm air duine, air àite no air rudeigin àraidh, m.e. *Mòrag*; *Seumas*; *Glaschu*; *BBC ALBA*; *an Gearasdan*. (iii) [...] (Cox 2017: §56)
  >
  > *noun*: the name of a thing or concept (e.g. “train”, “beauty”) or of a person or place (i.e. proper nouns, e.g. “Dr Who”, “Italy”). (Byrne 2002: 15)
  
- Note that Cox (2017: §56) lists five other classes of noun in addition to (and seemingly independent of) common and proper nouns: collective nouns (*ainmear trusaidh* eg. `clann`, `crodh`); quantity nouns (*ainmear meud* eg. `falt`, `bainne`); abstract nouns (*ainmear eas-cruthach* – see above); compound nouns (*ainmear fillte* eg. `taigh-beag`, `cailleach-dhubh`); and verbal nouns (*ainmear gnìomhaireach* eg. `dèanamh`, `ithe`). For present purposes, and with the obvious exception of his ‘compound nouns’ (many of which are not even nouns at all), these are best understood as semantic sub-classes of common noun.

## Grammatical categories of nouns

- Feminine nouns, masculine nouns and plural nouns
- [Nominative nouns, dative nouns and genitive nouns](#nominative-nouns-dative-nouns-and-genitive-nouns)

### Feminine nouns, masculine nouns and plural nouns

Nouns in Gaelic have *gender* – every noun is either *feminine* or *masculine* or *plural*.

Recall the *[Fionn](Fionn.md)* example passage from the previous section, reproduced below for convenience.

> Nuair a bha an **saoghal** òg bha **daoine** treuna ann, ris an canadh iad an **Fhiann**.
>
> B’ e **Cumhal** a b’ **ainm** air aon de na **daoine** seo, agus bha **mac** aige air an robh **Fionn**.
>
> Nuair a bha **Fionn** ’na **leanabh** beag, mharbhadh ’**athair** ann an aon de na **blàraibh** a chuir an **Fhiann** ’nam **measg** fhéin.
>
> Bha **eagal** air a **mhathair** gun tigeadh **naimhdean** ’**athar** air **tòir** an **leinibh**, agus mar sin chuir i e a-mach do na **coilltean** fàsail air **chùram** **dithis** **bhan** eòlach. 

The feminine nouns in this passage are `Fhiann` ‘warriors’, `mhàthair` ‘a mother’, `tòir` ‘a pursuit’ and `dithis` ‘a group of two people’.

The plural nouns are `daoine` ‘men’, `blàraibh` ‘battles’, `naimhdean` ‘enemies’, `coilltean` ‘forests’ and `bhan` ‘women’.

All the other nouns in the passage, whether proper or common, are masculine nouns – `saoghal` ‘a world’, `Cumhall` ‘Cumhal’, `ainm` ‘a name’, `mac` ‘a son’, `Fionn` ‘Finn’, `leanabh / leinibh` ‘an infant’, `athair / athar` ‘a father’, `measg` ‘midst’, `eagal` ‘fear’ and `chùram` ‘care’.

Notes:
  
- Traditional descriptions of Gaelic grammar usually distinguish between the two, allegedly orthogonal, grammatical categories of *gender* (feminine or masculine) and *number* (singular or plural). However, these categories are clearly *not* orthogonal in modern Gaelic, since there is no gender distinction whatsoever in the plural – plural nouns derived from feminine singulars behave in exactly the same way as those derived from masculine singulars. Therefore, it seems clear that ‘plural number’ in modern Gaelic is more accurately treated as a third (non-sex-based) grammatical gender.
  
- It is an exaggeration to claim that modern Gaelic has a third grammatical number – the ‘dual’. The relevant phenomena are more realistically explained as involving a handful of legacy inflectional peculiarities conditioned by the cardinal numeral `dà` ‘two’.

- Gender (in the sense assumed here) is only partially orthogonal to the distinction between proper and common nouns. While proper nouns can be either feminine or masculine, there appear to be no grammatically plural proper nouns. However, common nouns can be either feminine or masculine or plural.

- Some definitions from other grammarians of Gaelic:

  > In Gaelic, [nouns] can inflect for case and number. Gaelic nouns are grammatically gendered; they are inherently either masculine or feminine. (Lamb 2024: 37)
  > 
  > Faodaidh ainmearan a bhith aon chuid fireann no boireann; aon chuid singilte, deise no iolra. (Cox 2017: §55)

### Nominative nouns, dative nouns and genitive nouns

Nouns in Gaelic have *case* – every noun is either *nominative* or *dative* or *genitive*.

Coming back to this:

> Nuair a bha an **saoghal** òg bha **daoine** treuna ann, ris an canadh iad an **Fhiann**.
>
> B’ e **Cumhal** a b’ **ainm** air aon de na **daoine** seo, agus bha **mac** aige air an robh **Fionn**.
>
> Nuair a bha **Fionn** ’na **leanabh** beag, mharbhadh ’**athair** ann an aon de na **blàraibh** a chuir an **Fhiann** ’nam **measg** fhéin.
>
> Bha **eagal** air a **mhathair** gun tigeadh **naimhdean** ’**athar** air **tòir** an **leinibh**, agus mar sin chuir i e a-mach do na **coilltean** fàsail air **chùram** **dithis** **bhan** eòlach. 

In this passage, the dative nouns are `daoine` ‘men’ (the second occurence), `leanabh` ‘an infant’, `blàraibh` ‘battles’, `measg` ‘midst’, `mhàthair` ‘a mother’, `tòir` ‘a pursuit’, `coilltean` ‘forests’ and `chùram` ‘care’.

The genitive nouns are `athar` ‘a father’, `leinibh` ‘an infant’, `dithis` ‘a group of two people’ and `bhan` ‘women’.  

All the other nouns in the passage are nominative nouns – `saoghal` ‘a world’, `daoine` ‘men’ (the first occurence), `Fhiann` ‘warriors’ (both occurences), `Cumhal` ‘Cumhal’, `ainm` ‘a name’, `mac` ‘a son’, `Fionn` ‘Finn’ (both occurences), `athair` ‘a father’, `eagal` ‘fear’ and `naimhdean` ‘enemies’.

Notes:

- Traditional descriptions of Gaelic grammar commonly mention the ‘vocative’ as a fourth case. However, the vocative is not strictly speaking a grammatical case since it does not mark a syntactic relation between the noun and another verb, preposition, adjective or noun in the same sentence. For this reason, we will treat the vocative as a handful of inflectional idiosyncracies conditioned by the vocative particle `a`.

- Case is fully orthogonal to the other noun categories discussed thus far – proper vs. common nouns, and feminine vs. masculine vs. plural nouns.

- Some other definitions of case:
  
  > Faodaidh ainmearan a bhith [...] bunasach, ginideach, tabhartach no gairmeach. (Cox 2017: §55)

## Grammatical dependents of nouns

- Bare nouns
- [Modifiers of nouns](#modifiers-of-nouns)
- [Specifiers of nouns](#specifiers-of-nouns)
- [Apposition](#apposition)

### Bare nouns

If a noun has no grammatical dependents of any kind, it is known as a ‘bare’ noun.

*Proper nouns* usually occur bare.

> B’ e **Cumhal** a b’ ainm air aon de na daoine seo, agus bha mac aige air an robh **Fionn**.
>
> Is i siud a’ chiad shealg a rinn **Fionn**.

Note that unless otherwise specified all examples are adapted from the *[Fionn](Fionn.md)* text. Invented examples are marked as 🧩.

In these two examples, the nominative masculine proper nouns `Cumhal` and `Fionn` are both bare of grammatical dependents, even though they are themselves dependents (specifically subjects) of verbs, respectively `b’`, `robh` and `rinn`. 

*Common nouns* can also appear bare, in which case they have ‘indefinite’, unmodified meaning.

> Latha de na làithean chaidh e a-mach agus chunnaic e lach a’ snàmh air **loch**.
>
> Thilg e **urchair** oirre, agus gheàrr sin na sgiathan aice.
> 
> Bha aige ri an cumail ’nan cròileagan cruinn ann am badan àraidh, agus is ann le bhith sìor ruith timcheall orra a bha a chasan mu dheireadh cho luath ri casan **féidh**.

All three of the common nouns highlighted here lack any grammatical dependents, although they are all themselves dependents of other words in the sentence. The dative masculine noun `loch` ‘a lake’ is the complement of the preposition `air` ‘on’; the nominative feminine noun `urchair` ‘a shot, a stone’ is the object of the verb `thilg` ‘threw’; and the genitive masculine noun `féidh` ‘a deer’ is the specifier of the plural common noun `casan` ‘feet’.

### Modifiers of nouns

- Adjectives as modifiers of nouns
- [Genitive common nouns as modifiers of other nouns](genitive-common-nouns-as-modifiers-of-other-nouns)
- [Prepositions as modifiers of nouns](prepositions-as-modifiers-of-nouns)
- [Relative clause particles as modifiers of nouns](#relative-clause-particles-as-modifiers-of-nouns)

#### Adjectives as modifiers of nouns

A noun can have one or more adjective modifiers.

*Proper nouns* can be modified by adjectives.

> Phòs a mhàthair rìgh àraidh an déidh sin, ach cha do leig i **Fionn beag** as a h-aire.

Note that unless otherwise specified all examples are taken from the same text as was analysed in previous sections.

In the above example, the nominative masculine proper noun `Fionn` ‘Finn’ is modified by the adjective `beag` ‘little’ – `Fionn beag` ‘little Finn’.

*Common nouns* can be modified by adjectives too.

> Nuair a bha an saoghal òg bha **daoine treuna** ann, ris an canadh iad an Fhiann.
> 
> Nuair a bha Fionn ’na **leanabh beag**, mharbhadh ’athair ann an aon de na blàraibh a chuir an Fhiann ’nam measg fhéin.
> 
> Sheinn i **crònan milis binn** dha, agus an sin thog i oirre.

In the first of these examples, the nominative plural common noun `daoine` ‘men’ is modified by the adjective `treuna` ‘strong’ – `daoine treuna` ‘strong men’. In the second, the dative masculine common noun `leanabh` ‘an infant’ is modified by the adjective `beag` ‘little’ – `leanabh beag` ‘a little infant’. 

In the third example, the nominative masculine common noun `crònan` ‘tune’ has not one but *two* adjective modifiers, `milis` ‘sweet’ and `binn` ‘melodious’ – `crònan milis binn` ‘a sweet melodious tune’.

#### Genitive common nouns as modifiers of other nouns

A noun can have a genitive common noun modifier.

*Common nouns* can be modified by *non-plural* (feminine or masculine) genitive common nouns.

> Fhuair i e ’na **shuain chadail**, agus thog i e ’na làmhan gu sèimh socrach, agus phòg i e.

In this example, the dative feminine common noun `shuain` ‘slumber’ is modified by the masculine genitive common noun `chadail` ‘sleep’ – `shuain chadail` ‘slumber of sleep, sleepy slumber’.

Common nouns can also be modified by *plural* genitive common nouns.

> Bha an **dithis bhan** ud a’ toirt an aire air gus an do dh’fhàs e suas.

The nominative feminine common noun `dithis` ‘a group of two people’ is modified by the plural genitive common noun `bhan` ‘women’ – `dithis bhan` ‘a group of two women’.

It is not clear whether *proper nouns* can also be modified by (singular or plural) genitive common nouns, since there are no examples in the current text being analysed.

Back up to: [Nouns](#nouns) \| [Grammatical dependents of nouns](#grammatical-dependents-of-nouns) \| [Modifiers of nouns](#modifiers-of-nouns)

#### Prepositions as modifiers of nouns

A noun can have one or more prepositions as modifiers.

*Common nouns* can be modified by prepositions (which themselves take other nouns as their complements).

> B’ e Cumhal a b’ **ainm air** aon de na daoine seo, agus bha mac aige air an robh Fionn.
>
> Dh’fhalbh i **astar** fada **tro** thìr fhàsail gus an do lorg i an t-àite anns an robh an leanabh.
>
> Rachadh e a-mach don achadh far an robh **gearrain gu** leòr a’ ruith bho chnoc gu cnoc.

In the first example, the nominative masculine common noun `ainm` ‘name’ is modified by the preposition `air` ‘on’ (which itself has the complement `aon` ‘one’) – `ainm air aon de na daoine seo` ‘a name on (of) one of these men’. In the second example, the common noun `astar` ‘distance’ is modified by the preposition `tro` ‘through’ – `astar fada tro thìr fhàsail` ‘a long distance through desolate land’.

In the third example, the nominative plural common noun `gearrain` ‘hares’ is modified by the preposition `gu` ‘to’ (which itself has the complement `leòr` ‘sufficiency’) – `gearrain gu leòr` ‘hares to sufficiency, enough hares’.

Prepositional pronouns can be modifiers of common nouns all on their own.

> Thilg e urchair oirre, agus gheàrr sin na **sgiathan aice**.

Here, the nominative plural common noun `sgiathan` ‘wings’ is modified by the prepositional pronoun `aice` ‘at her’ – `sgiathan aice` ‘wings at her, her wings’.

Also, the progressive particle `ag` counts as a preposition in this respect.

> Latha de na làithean chaidh e mach agus chunnaic e **lach a’** snàmh air loch.

In this examples, the nominative feminine common noun `lach` ‘duck’ is modified by the particle `a’` (which itself takes the dative noun `snàmh` ‘swimming’ as its complement) – `lach a’ snàmh` ‘a duck swimming’.

It is not clear whether *proper nouns* can also be modified by prepositions, since there are no examples in the current text being analysed.

Notes:
  
- Strictly speaking, it is the preposition itself which is the grammatical modifier of the noun in these examples, and not the whole prepositional phrase. Grammatical relations, as we understand them, are between individual words and not between words and phrases.

#### Relative clause particles as modifiers of nouns

A noun can have one of the relative clause particles as a modifier.

##### The positive relative clause particle *a*

Both proper and common nouns can be modified by the positive relative clause particle `a`.

> 🧩 Mharbhadh **Cumhal**, **a** bha ’na rìgh àraidh.
> 
> Is i siud a’ chiad **shealg a** rinn Fionn.

In the first example, the nominative masculine proper noun `Cumhal` is modified by the particle `a` (which itself has the verb `bha` as its complement) – `Cumhal, a bha ’na rìgh àraidh` ‘Cumhal, who was an exceptional king’

In the second example, the nominative feminine common noun `shealg` is similarly modified by the particle `a` (which here takes the verb `rinn` as its complement) – `a’ chiad shealg a rinn Fionn` ‘the first hunt that Finn did’.

##### The negative relative clause particle *nach*

Similarly, both proper and common nouns can be modified by the negative relative clause particle `nach`.

> 🧩 Mharbhadh **Cumhal**, **nach** robh ’na rìgh àraidh.
>
> 🧩 Is e siud am **balach** **nach** deach a-mach don achadh.

In the first example, the nominative masculine proper noun `Cumhal` is modified by the particle `nach` (which itself has the verb `robh` as its complement) – `Cumhal, nach robh ’na rìgh àraidh` ‘Cumhal, who was not an exceptional king’

In the second example, the nominative masculine common noun `balach` is similarly modified by the particle `a` (which here takes the verb `deach` as its complement) – `am balach nach deach a-mach don achadh` ‘the boy who didn’t go out to the field’.

##### The locative relative clause particle *far*

The locative relative clause particle `far` ‘where’ can also be used to modify both common and proper nouns (specifically placenames).

> Rachadh e a-mach don **achadh** **far** an robh gearrain gu leòr a’ ruith bho chnoc gu cnoc.
>
> 🧩 Bha Fionn ann an **Glaschu**, **far** an do mharbhadh ’athair.

In the first example, the dative masculine common noun `achadh` is modified by the particle `far` (which takes as its complement the positive interrogative verb particle `an`) – `an t-achadh far an robh gearrain a’ ruith` ‘the field where hares were running’.

In the second example, it is the proper noun `Glaschu` which is modified by `far` – `Glaschu, far an do mharbhadh ’athair` ‘Glasgow, where his father was killed’.

##### Prepositional relative clause particles

Common nouns can also be modified by prepositional relative clause particles.

> Nuair a bha an saoghal òg bha **daoine** treuna ann, **ris** an canadh iad an Fhiann.
>
> Dh’fhalbh i astar fada troimh thìr fhàsail gus an do lorg i an **t-àite anns** an robh an leanabh.

In the first example here, the nominative plural common noun `daoine` ‘men’ is modified by the prepositional relative clause particle `ris` ‘against whom’ (which takes as complement the positive interrogative verb particle `an`, which itself takes as complement the verb `canadh` ‘would say’) – `daoine ris an canadh iad an Fhiann` ‘men against whom they would say the Fianna (ie. men whom they would call the Fianna)’.

In the second example, the nominative masculine common noun `t-àite` ‘place’ is modified by the prepositional relative clause particle `anns` ‘in which’ (which also takes as complement the positive interrogative verb particle `an`, which itself takes as complement the verb `robh` ‘was’) – `àite anns an robh an leanabh` ‘place in which the infant was’.



It is not clear whether *proper nouns* can also be modified by relative clause particles, since there are no examples in the current text being analysed.

### Apposition

Lamb (2024:37): “In Gaelic, most nouns can be preceded by a determiner, such as the definite article (‘the’), [...]. [...] As the head of a noun phrase, nouns maye be modified by adjectives, with which they share several properties. Adjectives modify a noun within a noun phrase or provide additional information about it, such as serving to restrict possible reference.”

Lamb (2024:38): “Determiners are added to a noun phrase to restrict or specify its reference. [...] Demonstratives [...] are used to mark a noun’s position or prominence. [...] [C]ardinal numerals [...] state the count of the nouns in discussion and ordinal numerals [...] state the position of the noun in a sequence [...]. [...] Prepositions indicate relationships between nouns, [...].”

## Grammatical functions of nouns

- Grammatical functions of nominative nouns
- [Grammatical functions of dative nouns](#grammatical-functions-of-dative-nouns)
- [Grammatical functions of genitive nouns](#grammatical-functions-of-genitive-nouns)

The grammatical functions that nouns can have in a Gaelic sentence are the different ways in which they can serve as a dependent of some other word in the sentence, whether that other word is a verb, preposition or even another noun. These grammatical functions depend crucially on the *case* of the noun – whether it is nominative, dative or genitive.

### Grammatical functions of nominative nouns

Nominative nouns can have three main kinds of grammatical function in a sentence of Gaelic: 
- subject of a verb
- object of a verb
- dependent of the copula

#### Nominative nouns as subject of a verb

The most common grammatical function of nominative nouns is to serve as the subject of a verb.

In the following example, the nominative proper noun *Fionn* is being used as the grammatical subject of the verb *bha* ‘was’, which is itself a form of the predicative verb *bi*: 

> Nuair a **bha** **Fionn** ’na leanabh beag, mharbhadh ’athair ann an aon de na blàraibh a chuir an Fhiann ’nam measg fhéin.

And in these examples, it is the nominative common nouns *eagal* ‘fear’, *gillean* ‘boys’ and *leanabh* ‘an infant’ that are being used in the same way:

> **Bha** **eagal** air a mhathair gun tigeadh naimhdean ’athar air tòir an leinibh.
>
> Ged nach robh e a-riamh ann an sgoil mar a **tha** na **gillean** an-diugh, cha robh e idir a’ cur seachad a làithean ’na thàmh.
>
> Dh’fhalbh i astar fada troimh thìr fhàsail gus an do lorg i an t-àite anns an **robh** an **leanabh**.

Here are some examples of both proper and common nominative nouns being used as the grammatical subjects of other verbs:

> Bha eagal air a mhathair gun **tigeadh** **naimhdean** ’athar air tòir an leinibh.
>
> **Phòs** a **mhàthair** rìgh àraidh an déidh sin, ach cha do leig i Fionn beag às a h-aire.
>
> Is i siud a’ chiad shealg a **rinn** **Fionn**.

#### Nominative nouns as object of a verb

Nominative nouns can also be grammatical *objects* of a verb.

Here is an example with the nominative proper noun *Fionn* as object of the active verb *leig* ‘allow’:

> Phòs a mhàthair rìgh àraidh an déidh sin, ach cha do **leig** i **Fionn** beag às a h-aire.

Some corresponding examples with common nouns are as follows:

> **Phòs** a mhàthair **rìgh** àraidh an déidh sin.
>
> Latha de na làithean chaidh e a-mach agus **chunnaic** e **lach** a’ snàmh air loch.
>
> **Thilg** e **urchair** oirre, agus **gheàrr** sin na **sgiathan** aice.

In the next example, it is the (nominative) *verbal* noun *tighinn* ‘coming’ which is functioning as the grammatical object of the verb *leigeadh* ‘would allow’:

> Chuireadh na mnathan a-mach air an loch e, agus **leigeadh** iad leis **tighinn** gu tìr mar a b’ fheàrr a dh’fhaodadh e.

Finally, a nominative noun can also function as the grammatical object of a (subject-less) *passive* verb:

> Nuair a bha Fionn ’na leanabh beag, **mharbhadh** ’**athair** ann an aon de na blàraibh a chuir an Fhiann ’nam measg fhéin.

Here the nominative noun *athair* ‘father’ functions as the grammatical object of the passive verb *mharbhadh* ‘someone killed’ – *mharbhadh ’athair* ‘someone killed his father, ie. his father was killed’.

#### Nominative nouns as dependent of the copula

Closely related to their use as subject and object of a verb, nominative nouns can function as either of the two dependents identified by (a form of) the copula.

> **Is** i siud a’ chiad **shealg** a rinn Fionn.
> 
> **B’** e **Cumhal** a **b’** **ainm** air aon de na daoine seo, agus bha mac aige air an robh Fionn.

In the first example, the nominative common noun *shealg* ‘hunt’ is one of the dependents of the copula form *is* (the other depedent being the demonstrative pronoun *siud*).

In the second example, the nominative proper noun *Cumhal* is a dependent of the first instance of the copula form *b’*, and the nominative common noun *ainm* ‘name’ is one of the dependents of the second instance.

### Grammatical functions of dative nouns

The sole function of a dative noun is to mark the complement of a preposition.

Here are an example where a dative common noun is used as the complement of a preposition: 

> Nuair a bha Fionn **’na leanabh** beag, mharbhadh ’athair ann an aon **de** na **blàraibh** a chuir an Fhiann **’nam measg** fhéin.

Here, the noun *leanabh* ‘an infant’ is the complement of the fused preposition *’na*, an ebbreviated form of *ann an a* ‘in his’. Similarly *blàraibh* ‘battles’ is the complement of *de* ‘of’, and *measg* ‘midst’ is the complement of *‘nam* (*ann an am*) ‘in their’.

A few more examples of dative nouns as complements of prepositions are as follows:

> Bha eagal **air** a **mhathair** gun tigeadh naimhdean ’athar **air tòir** an leinibh, agus mar sin chuir i e a-mach **do** na **coilltean** fàsail **air chùram** dithis bhan eòlach.
>
> Dh’fhalbh i astar fada **tro thìr** fhàsail gus an do lorg i an t-àite anns an robh an leanabh.
> 
> Bha aige **ri** an **cumail** **’nan cròileagan** cruinn **ann am badan** àraidh, agus is ann **le bhith** sìor ruith timcheall orra a bha a chasan **mu dheireadh** cho luath **ri casan** féidh.

In the last example here, note that the complement of the preposition *ri* is *cumail* ‘keeping’, a verbal noun. Similarly, the complement of *le* ‘with’ is the verbal noun *bhith* ‘being’. Here are a few more examples of prepositions being used with verbal noun complements:
 
Verbal nouns:

> Fhuair i e **’na shuain** chadail, agus thog i e ’na làmhan gu sèimh socrach, agus phòg i e.
>
> Latha de na làithean chaidh e a-mach agus chunnaic e lach **a’ snàmh** air loch.

### Grammatical functions of genitive nouns

#### Specifier of another noun

One of the main functions of a genitive noun, whether proper of common, is to mark the specifier of another, preceding, noun:

> Bha aige ri an cumail ’nan cròileagan cruinn ann am badan àraidh, agus is ann le bhith sìor ruith timcheall orra a bha a chasan mu dheireadh cho luath ri **casan féidh**.
>
> Bha eagal air a mhathair gun tigeadh **naimhdean ’athar** air tòir an **leinibh**, agus mar sin chuir i e a-mach do na coilltean fàsail air **chùram dithis** bhan eòlach.

In the first example, the genitive masculine noun *féidh* ‘deer’ is functioning as the specifier of the plural noun *casan* ‘feet’. In the second example, masculine *athar* ‘father’ is the specifier of *naimhdean* ‘enemies’, *leinibh* ‘an infant’ is the specifier of *tòir* ‘a pursuit’, and *dithis* ‘a group of two people’ is the specifier of *chùram* ‘care’.

In the following example, the genitive plural noun *làithean* ‘days’ is the specifier of the verbal noun *cur* ‘sending’:

> Ged nach robh e a-riamh ann an sgoil mar a tha na gillean an-diugh, cha robh e idir a’ **cur** seachad a **làithean** ’na thàmh.

Note that the genitive specifier of a verbal noun typically marks what would be the *object* of the underlying verb (which would have nominative case of course).

#### Modifier of another noun

Genitive common nouns (but not proper noun) have a second important function – to mark a modifier of the immediately preceding noun.

> Bha eagal air a mhathair gun tigeadh naimhdean ’athar air tòir an leinibh, agus mar sin chuir i e a-mach do na coilltean fàsail air chùram dithis **bhan** eòlach.
>
> Fhuair i e ’na shuain **chadail**, agus thog i e ’na làmhan gu sèimh socrach, agus phòg i e.
>
> Bha an dithis **bhan** ud a’ toirt an aire air gus an d’ fhàs e suas.

Of a verbal noun:

> Bhiodh e a’ snàmh gach dàrna **latha**. [hidden preposition?]

no specifier!

Lamb (2024:37): “The main function of a noun is to act as a verbal argument.”

Lamb (2024:38): “Determiners are added to a noun phrase to restrict or specify its reference. [...] Demonstratives [...] are used to mark a noun’s position or prominence. [...] [C]ardinal numerals [...] state the count of the nouns in discussion and ordinal numerals [...] state the position of the noun in a sequence [...]. [...] Prepositions indicate relationships between nouns, as well as between nouns and verbs.”
