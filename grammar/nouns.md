# Nouns

## Semantic characteristics

### Concrete and abstract nouns

Nouns are words that typically denote *material* entities – individuals, substances, aggregates and groups which are literally *made of matter* (atoms, molecules, etc.). Every word that denotes a material entity is a noun (or ‘pronoun’ – see below), though not every noun denotes a material entity. Nouns which denote material entities are known as *concrete* nouns, and nouns which denote non-material entities are known as *abstract* nouns. 

In the following short text (from Lachlann MacFhionghuin *Leabhraichean Leughaidh* Vol.II td.81) the nouns are all underlined –

> An <ins>uair</ins> a bha an <ins>saoghal</ins> òg bha <ins>daoine</ins> treuna ann, ris an canadh iad an <ins>Fhiann</ins>. B’ e <ins>Cumhal</ins> a b’ <ins>ainm</ins> air aon de na <ins>daoine</ins> so, agus bha <ins>mac</ins> aige air an robh <ins>Fionn</ins>.
> An <ins>uair</ins> a bha <ins>Fionn</ins> ’n a <ins>leanabh</ins> beag, mharbhadh <ins>athair</ins> ann an aon de na <ins>blàraibh</ins> a chuir an <ins>Fhiann</ins> ’nam <ins>measg</ins> fhéin. Bha <ins>eagal</ins> air a <ins>mhathair</ins> gun tigeadh <ins>naimhdean</ins> <ins>athar</ins> air <ins>tòir</ins> an <ins>leinibh</ins>, agus mar sin chuir i e a mach do na <ins>coilltean</ins> fàsail air <ins>chùram</ins> <ins>dithis</ins> <ins>mhnathan</ins> eòlach. 

The concrete nouns in this passage are –
> **saoghal** ‘world’  
> **daoine** ‘men’  
> **Fhiann** ‘warrior class’  
> **Cumhal** ‘Cumhal’  
> **mac** ‘son’  
> **Fionn** ‘Finn’  
> **leanabh** (**leinibh**) ‘infant’  
> **athair** (**athar**) ‘father’  
> **mhathair** ‘mother’  
> **naimhdean** ‘enemies’  
> **coilltean** ‘woods’  
> **dithis** ‘two people’  
> **mhnathan** ‘women’

The abstract nouns in the passage are –
> **uair** ‘time’  
> **ainm** ‘name’  
> **blàraibh** ‘battles’  
> **measg** ‘midst’  
> **eagal** ‘fear’  
> **tòir** ‘pursuit’  
> **chùram** ‘care’ 

Notes:
1. Lamb (2024:37): “Nouns are a time-stable class denoting entities, places and objects, as well as concepts that have similar grammatical behaviour.” *ubhal* ‘apple’, *nighean* ‘girl’, *clann* ‘children’, *Dòmhnall* ‘Donald’, *Glaschu* ‘Glasgow’, *beachd* ‘opinion’, *astar* ‘distance’

### Proper nouns and common nouns

There are two main kinds of noun –
- **proper nouns** are names of particular entities
- **common nouns** denote classes of entity

The proper nouns in the previous passage are –
> **Cumhal**  
> **Fionn**

All the other nouns in the passage are common nouns –
> **uair**  
> **saoghal**  
> **daoine**  
> **Fhiann**  
> **ainm**  
> **mac**  
> **leanabh** (**leinibh**)  
> **athair** (**athar**)  
> **blàraibh**  
> **measg**  
> **eagal**  
> **mhathair**  
> **naimhdean**  
> **tòir**  
> **coilltean**  
> **chùram**  
> **dithis**  
> **mhnathan**

Note that ***Fhiann*** is correctly classified as a common noun even though it begins with a capital letter. ***Fhiann*** is not a proper noun which names a particular group of men, but rather is a common noun (denoting a class of groups of men) which is being used as part of a phrase ***An Fhiann***, and it is this phrase as a whole which names the particular group of men. 

### Pronouns

Lamb (2024:38): “Pronouns are short words that stand in for noun phrases.”

## Grammatical categories

Nouns have **gender** – every noun is either **feminine** or **masculine** or **plural**.

Nouns have **case** – every noun is either **nominative** or **dative** or **genitive**.

Notes:
- Lamb (2024:37): “In Gaelic, most nouns [...] can inflect for case and number. Gaelic nouns are grammatically gendered; they are inherently either masculine or feminine.”
- dual number/gender? vocative case? 

## Dependents

Lamb (2024:37): “In Gaelic, most nouns can be preceded by a determiner, such as the definite article (‘the’), [...]. [...] As the head of a noun phrase, nouns maye be modified by adjectives, with which they share several properties. Adjectives modify a noun within a noun phrase or provide additional information about it, such as serving to restrict possible reference.”

Lamb (2024:38): “Determiners are added to a noun phrase to restrict or specify its reference. [...] Demonstratives [...] are used to mark a noun’s position or prominence. [...] [C]ardinal numerals [...] state the count of the nouns in discussion and ordinal numerals [...] state the position of the noun in a sequence [...]. [...] Prepositions indicate relationships between nouns, [...].”

## Functions

Lamb (2024:37): “The main function of a noun is to act as a verbal argument.”

Lamb (2024:38): “Determiners are added to a noun phrase to restrict or specify its reference. [...] Demonstratives [...] are used to mark a noun’s position or prominence. [...] [C]ardinal numerals [...] state the count of the nouns in discussion and ordinal numerals [...] state the position of the noun in a sequence [...]. [...] Prepositions indicate relationships between nouns, as well as between nouns and verbs.”
