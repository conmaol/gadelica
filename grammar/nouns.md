### Concrete nouns and abstract nouns

Nouns are words that typically denote *material* entities.

Material entities are those individuals, substances, aggregates and groups which are literally *made of matter*, consisting of atoms, organised into molecules, crystals, and so on. 

Every word that denotes a material entity is a noun (or a [pronoun](pronouns.md)). 

However, not every noun denotes a material entity. Some nouns denote *non-material* entities, which are not made out of matter. Non-material entities include spaces (places and paths) and situations (states, processes, events and actions).

Nouns that denote material entities are known as *concrete* nouns, and nouns that denote non-material entities are known as *abstract* nouns. 

The following passage is adapted from Lachlann MacFhionghuin’s (c.1950) *Leabhraichean Leughaidh: Leabhar II* (p.81). All and only the nouns have been highlighted.

> Nuair a bha an **saoghal** òg bha **daoine** treuna ann, ris an canadh iad an **Fhiann**.
>
> B’ e **Cumhal** a b’ **ainm** air aon de na **daoine** seo, agus bha **mac** aige air an robh **Fionn**.
>
> Nuair a bha **Fionn** ’na **leanabh** beag, mharbhadh ’**athair** ann an aon de na **blàraibh** a chuir an **Fhiann** ’nam **measg** fhéin.
>
> Bha **eagal** air a **mhàthair** gun tigeadh **naimhdean** ’**athar** air **tòir** an **leinibh**, agus mar sin chuir i e a-mach do na **coilltean** fàsail air **chùram** **dithis** **bhan** eòlach. 

The concrete nouns in this passage are
*saoghal* ‘a world’,
*daoine* ‘men’,
*Fhiann* ‘warriors’,
*Cumhall* ‘Cumhall’,
*mac* ‘a son’,
*Fionn* ‘Finn’,
*leanabh* (*leinibh*) ‘an infant’,
*athair* (*athar*) ‘a father’,
*mhàthair* ‘a mother’,
*naimhdean* ‘enemies’,
*coilltean* ‘forests’,
*dithis* ‘a group of two people’ and
*bhan* ‘women’.

The abstract nouns in the passage are 
*ainm* ‘a name’,
*blàraibh* ‘battles’,
*measg* ‘midst’,
*eagal* ‘fear’,
*tòir* ‘a pursuit’ and
*chùram* ‘care’.

Notes:

- Some readers might be uncomfortable seeing words like *measg*, *tòir* and perhaps even *chùram* classified as (abstract) nouns in the above, preferring to think of them as parts of (complex) *prepositions* rather than words in and of themselves. This is a false binary – *measg*, *tòir* and *chùram* are *both* components of (lexicalised) prepositional compounds *and* (perhaps fossilised) nouns.
  
- The (concrete) noun *dithis* ‘a group of two people’ is most accurately classified as a (concrete) noun with numeric meaning, rather than as a numeral *per se*.

- Nouns have been defined in broadly similar terms by other grammarians of Gaelic:
  > Nouns are a time-stable class denoting entities, places and objects, as well as concepts that have similar grammatical behaviour. Examples of nouns are *ubhal* ‘apple’, *nighean* ‘girl’, *clann* ‘children’, *beachd* ‘opinion’, *astar* ‘distance’, *Dòmhnall* ‘Donald’ and *Glaschu* ‘Glasgow’. (Lamb 2024: 37)
  > 
  > Tha ainmear ’na ainm air duine no air nì, m.e. *boireannach*; *balach*; *bòrd*; *doras*. (Cox 2017: §55)
  >
  > Ainmear eas-cruthach, a tha ’na ainm air rudeigin nach cluinn, nach fhaic, agus ris nach bean duine, m.e. *an fhìrinn*; *an t-slàinte*; *am bàs*; *a’ bheatha*; *a’ chogais* 7c – seach *bòrd*; *doras* 7c a tha ’na ainmearan cruthach. (Cox 2017: §56(v))

### Proper nouns and common nouns

Nouns can be further classified according to the nature of their denotation, or the way in which they relate to entities in the world.

*Proper nouns* are names of particular entities

*Common nouns* denote classes of entity

In the passage from the previous section, there are two proper nouns – *Cumhal* ‘Cumhall’ and *Fionn* ‘Finn’. 

All the other nouns in the passage, whether concrete or abstract, are common nouns – 
*saoghal* ‘a world’,
*daoine* ‘men’,
*Fhiann* ‘warriors’,
*ainm* ‘a name’,
*mac* ‘a son’,
*leanabh* (*leinibh*) ‘an infant’,
*athair* (*athar*) ‘a father’,
*blàraibh* ‘battles’,
*measg* ‘midst’,
*eagal* ‘fear’,
*mhàthair* ‘a mother’,
*naimhdean* ‘enemies’,
*tòir* ‘a pursuit’,
*coilltean* ‘forests’,
*chùram* ‘care’.
*dithis* ‘a group of two people’, and
*bhan* ‘women’.

Notes:

- Proper nouns are always capitalised in writing, even when they do not occur as the first word in a sentence. However, not all capitalised nouns in the middle of a sentence are proper nouns. For example, *Fhiann* ‘warriors’ in the passage above is correctly classified as a common noun. It is capitalised in the text because it is the core element (the ‘head’) of a phrase, *an Fhiann* ‘the Warriors’, which is being presented as the name of a particular group of men (cf. ‘the Fenians’). Moreover, even though *an Fhiann* is a name, it would be incorrect to characterise it as a proper noun, since it is not a noun.
  
- The dimensions of concrete vs. abstract and proper vs. common are not truly orthogonal. It seems that all proper nouns are concrete, and hence that all abstract nouns are common.

- The distinction between proper and common nouns is familiar from the work of other grammarians of Gaelic (even if they typically confuse proper nouns with names in general):
  
  >  Gaelic has two broad noun categories: common nouns and proper nouns. Common nouns are the physical and abstract entities that we discuss regularly in language, such as ‘bird’, ‘mountain’ or ‘philosophy’. Proper nouns are those items that we normally capitalise in writing, such as persons (‘Donald’) and places (‘Cape Breton’).” (Lamb 2024: 46)
  > 
  > Tha diofar sheòrsaichean ainmearan ann: (i) Ainmear cumanta, a tha na ainm air rudeigin bitheanta, m.e. *boireannach*; *cat*; *bròg*; *sùil*; *aran*; *taigh*. (ii) Ainmear sònraichte, a tha na ainm air duine, air àite no air rudeigin àraidh, m.e. *Mòrag*; *Seumas*; *Glaschu*; *BBC ALBA*; *an Gearasdan*. (iii) [...] (Cox 2017: §56)
  >
  > *noun*: the name of a thing or concept (e.g. “train”, “beauty”) or of a person or place (i.e. proper nouns, e.g. “Dr Who”, “Italy”). (Byrne 2002: 15)
  
- Note that Cox (2017: §56) lists five other classes of noun in addition to common and proper nouns – collective nouns (*ainmear trusaidh* eg. *clann*, *muinntir*, *òigridh*, *crodh*, *dream*, *eunlaith*, *gràisg*); quantity nouns (*ainmear meud* eg. *falt*, *feur*, *bainne*, *uisge*, *gainmheach*); abstract nouns (*ainmear eas-cruthach* – see above); compound nouns (*ainmear fillte* eg. *taigh-beag*, *cailleach-dhubh*, *trom-laighe*); and verbal nouns (*ainmear gnìomhaireach* eg. *dèanamh*, *iarraidh*, *ithe*, *tuigsinn*, *bruidhinn*). For present purposes, and with the obvious exception of his ‘compound nouns’ (many of which are not even nouns at all), these are best understood as semantic sub-classes of common noun.

## Grammatical categories of nouns

- Feminine nouns, masculine nouns and plural nouns
- [Nominative nouns, dative nouns and genitive nouns](#nominative-nouns-dative-nouns-and-genitive-nouns)

### Feminine nouns, masculine nouns and plural nouns

Nouns in Gaelic have *gender* – every noun is either *feminine* or *masculine* or *plural*.

Recall the example passage from the previous section, reproduced below for convenience.

> Nuair a bha an **saoghal** òg bha **daoine** treuna ann, ris an canadh iad an **Fhiann**.
>
> B’ e **Cumhal** a b’ **ainm** air aon de na **daoine** seo, agus bha **mac** aige air an robh **Fionn**.
>
> Nuair a bha **Fionn** ’na **leanabh** beag, mharbhadh ’**athair** ann an aon de na **blàraibh** a chuir an **Fhiann** ’nam **measg** fhéin.
>
> Bha **eagal** air a **mhathair** gun tigeadh **naimhdean** ’**athar** air **tòir** an **leinibh**, agus mar sin chuir i e a-mach do na **coilltean** fàsail air **chùram** **dithis** **bhan** eòlach. 

The feminine nouns in this passage are *Fhiann* ‘warriors’, *mhàthair* ‘a mother’, *tòir* ‘a pursuit’ and *dithis* ‘a group of two people’.

The plural nouns are *daoine* ‘men’, *blàraibh* ‘battles’, *naimhdean* ‘enemies’, *coilltean* ‘forests’ and *bhan* ‘women’.

All the other nouns in the passage, whether proper or common, are masculine nouns – *saoghal* ‘a world’, *Cumhall* ‘Cumhal’, *ainm* ‘a name’, *mac* ‘a son’, *Fionn* ‘Finn’, *leanamh*/*leinibh* ‘an infant’, *athair*/*athar* ‘a father’, *measg* ‘midst’, *eagal* ‘fear’ and *chùram* ‘care’.

Notes:
  
- Traditional descriptions of Gaelic grammar usually distinguish between the two, allegedly orthogonal, grammatical categories of *gender* (feminine or masculine) and *number* (singular or plural). However, these categories are clearly *not* orthogonal in modern Gaelic, since there is no gender distinction whatsoever in the plural – plural nouns derived from feminine singulars behave in exactly the same way as those derived from masculine singulars. Therefore, it seems clear that ‘plural number’ in modern Gaelic is more accurately treated as a third (non-sex-based) grammatical gender.
  
- It is an exaggeration to claim that modern Gaelic has a third grammatical number – the ‘dual’. The relevant phenomena are more realistically explained as involving a handful of legacy inflectional peculiarities conditioned by the cardinal numeral *dà* ‘two’.

- Gender (in the sense assumed here) is only partially orthogonal to the distinction between proper and common nouns. While proper nouns can be either feminine or masculine, there appear to be no grammatically plural proper nouns. However, common nouns can be either feminine or masculine or plural.

- Some definitions from other grammarians of Gaelic:

  > In Gaelic, [nouns] can inflect for case and number. Gaelic nouns are grammatically gendered; they are inherently either masculine or feminine. (Lamb 2024: 37)
  > 
  > Faodaidh ainmearan a bhith aon chuid fireann no boireann; aon chuid singilte, deise no iolra. (Cox 2017: §55)

Back up to: [Nouns](#nouns) \| [Grammatical categories of nouns](#grammatical-categories-of-nouns)

### Nominative nouns, dative nouns and genitive nouns

Nouns in Gaelic have *case* – every noun is either *nominative* or *dative* or *genitive*.

In the passage from the previous section, the dative nouns are *daoine* ‘men’ (the second occurence), *leanabh* ‘an infant’, *blàraibh* ‘battles’, *measg* ‘midst’, *mhàthair* ‘a mother’, *tòir* ‘a pursuit’, *coilltean* ‘forests’ and *chùram* ‘care’.

The genitive nouns are *athar* ‘a father’, *leinibh* ‘an infant’, *dithis* ‘a group of two people’ and *bhan* ‘women’.  

All the other nouns in the passage are nominative nouns – *saoghal* ‘a world’, *daoine* ‘men’ (the first occurence), *Fhiann* ‘warriors’ (both occurences), *Cumhal* ‘Cumhal’, *ainm* ‘a name’, *mac* ‘a son’, *Fionn* ‘Finn’ (both occurences), *athair* ‘a father’, *eagal* ‘fear’ and *naimhdean* ‘enemies’.

Notes:

- Traditional descriptions of Gaelic grammar commonly mention the ‘vocative’ as a fourth case. However, the vocative is not strictly speaking a grammatical case since it does not mark a syntactic relation between the noun and another verb, preposition, adjective or noun in the same sentence. For this reason, we will treat the vocative as a handful of inflectional idiosyncracies conditioned by the vocative particle *a*.

- Case is fully orthogonal to the other noun categories discussed thus far – proper vs. common nouns, and feminine vs. masculine vs. plural nouns.

- Some other definitions of case:
  
  > Faodaidh ainmearan a bhith [...] bunasach, ginideach, tabhartach no gairmeach. (Cox 2017: §55)

## Dependents of nouns

- Bare nouns

- [Specifiers of nouns](#specifiers-of-nouns)
- [Apposition](#apposition)

### Bare nouns

If a noun has no dependents of any kind, it is known as a ‘bare’ noun.

*Proper nouns* usually occur bare.

> B’ e **Cumhal** a b’ ainm air aon de na daoine seo, agus bha mac aige air an robh **Fionn**.
>
> Is i siud a’ chiad shealg a rinn **Fionn**.

Note that unless otherwise specified all examples are taken from the same text as was analysed in previous sections.

In these two examples, the nominative masculine proper nouns *Cumhal* and both instances of *Fionn* are both bare of dependents, even though they are all dependents (specifically subjects) of verbs, respectively *b’* (*bu*), *robh* and *rinn*. 

*Common nouns* can also appear bare, in which case they have ‘indefinite’, unmodified meaning.

> Latha de na làithean chaidh e a-mach agus chunnaic e lach a’ snàmh air **loch**.
>
> Thilg e **urchair** oirre, agus gheàrr sin na sgiathan aice.
> 
> Bha aige ri an cumail ’nan cròileagan cruinn ann am badan àraidh, agus is ann le bhith sìor ruith timcheall orra a bha a chasan mu dheireadh cho luath ri casan **féidh**.

All three of the common nouns highlighted here lack any dependents, although they are all dependents of other words in the sentence. The dative masculine noun *loch* ‘a lake’ is the complement of the preposition *air* ‘on’; the nominative feminine noun *urchair* ‘a shot, a stone’ is the object of the verb *thilg* ‘threw’; and the genitive masculine noun *féidh* ‘a deer’ is the specifier of the plural common noun *casan* ‘feet’.

### Modifiers of nouns

- Adjectives as modifiers of nouns
- [Genitive nouns as modifiers of other nouns](genitive-nouns-as-modifiers-of-other-nouns)
- [Prepositions as modifiers of nouns](prepositions-as-modifiers-of-nouns)
- [Relative clause particles as modifiers of nouns](#relative-clause-particles-as-modifiers-of-nouns)

#### Adjectives as modifiers of nouns

A noun can have one or more adjective modifiers.

*Proper nouns* can be modified by adjectives.

> Phòs a mhàthair rìgh àraidh an déidh sin, ach cha do leig i <mark title="The nominative masculine proper noun ‘Fionn’ [Finn] is modified by the adjective ‘beag’ [little] – ‘Little Finn’.">Fionn beag</mark> as a h-aire.

Note that unless otherwise specified all examples are taken from the same text as was analysed in previous sections.

In the above example, the nominative masculine proper noun *Fionn* ‘Finn’ is modified by the adjective *beag* ‘little’ – *Fionn beag* ‘little Finn’.

*Common nouns* can be modified by adjectives too.

> Nuair a bha an saoghal òg bha <mark title="The nominative plural common noun ‘daoine’ [men] is modified by the adjective ‘treuna’ [strong] – ‘strong men’.">daoine treuna</mark> ann, ris an canadh iad an Fhiann.
> 
> Nuair a bha Fionn ’na <mark title="The dative masculine common noun ‘leanabh’ [an infant] is modified by the adjective ‘beag’ [little] – ‘a little infant’.">leanabh beag</mark>, mharbhadh ’athair ann an aon de na blàraibh a chuir an Fhiann ’nam measg fhéin.
> 
> Sheinn i <mark title="The nominative masculine common noun ‘crònan’ [tune] is modified by the adjectives ‘milis’ [sweet] and ‘binn’ [melodious] – ‘sweet melodious tune’.">crònan milis binn</mark> dha, agus an sin thog i oirre.

In the first of these examples, the nominative plural common noun ***daoine*** ‘men’ is modified by the adjective ***treuna*** ‘strong’ – ***daoine treuna*** ‘strong men’. In the second, the dative masculine common noun ***leanabh*** ‘an infant’ is modified by the adjective ***beag*** ‘little’ – ***leanabh beag*** ‘a little infant’. 

In the third example, the nominative masculine common noun ***crònan*** ‘tune’ has not one but *two* adjective modifiers, ***milis*** ‘sweet’ and ***binn*** ‘melodious’ – ***crònan milis binn*** ‘a sweet melodious tune’.

#### Genitive nouns as modifiers of other nouns

A noun can have a genitive noun modifier.

*Common nouns* can be modified by *non-plural* (feminine or masculine) genitive nouns.

> Fhuair i e ’na <mark title="The dative feminine common noun ‘shuain’ [slumber] is modified by the masculine genitive noun ‘chadail’ [sleep] – ‘slumber of sleep, sleepy slumber’.">shuain chadail</mark>, agus thog i e ’na làmhan gu sèimh socrach, agus phòg i e.

In this example, the dative feminine common noun ***shuain*** ‘slumber’ is modified by the masculine genitive noun ***chadail*** ‘sleep’ – ***shuain chadail*** ‘slumber of sleep, sleepy slumber’.

Common nouns can also be modified by *plural* genitive nouns.

> Bha an <mark title="The nominative feminine common noun ‘dithis’ [group of two people] is modified by the plural genitive noun ‘mhnathan’ [women] – ‘group of two women’.">dithis bhan</mark> ud a’ toirt an aire air gus an d’ fhàs e suas.

The nominative feminine common noun ***dithis*** ‘a group of two people’ is modified by the plural genitive noun ***bhan*** ‘women’ – ***dithis bhan*** ‘a group of two women’.

It is not clear whether *proper nouns* can also be modified by genitive nouns, since there are no examples in the current text being analysed.

Back up to: [Nouns](#nouns) \| [Dependents of nouns](#dependents-of-nouns) \| [Modifiers of nouns](#modifiers-of-nouns)

#### Prepositions as modifiers of nouns

A noun can have one or more prepositions as modifiers.

*Common nouns* can be modified by prepositions (which themselves take other nouns as their complements).

> B’ e Cumhal a b’ <mark title="The nominative masculine common noun ‘ainm’ [name] is modified by the preposition ‘air’ [on] – ‘the name on/of one of these men’.">ainm air</mark> aon de na daoine seo, agus bha mac aige air an robh Fionn.
>
> Dh’fhalbh i <mark title="The nominative masculine common noun ‘astar’ [distance] is modified by the preposition ‘tro’ [through] – ‘long distance through desolate land’.">astar</mark> fada <mark>tro</mark> thìr fhàsail gus an do lorg i an t-àite anns an robh an leanabh.
>
> Rachadh e a-mach don achadh far an robh <mark title="The nominative plural common noun ‘gearrain’ [hares] is modified by the preposition ‘gu’ [to] – ‘hares to sufficiency, enough hares’.">gearrain gu</mark> leòr a’ ruith bho chnoc gu cnoc.

In the first example, the nominative masculine common noun ***ainm*** ‘name’ is modified by the preposition ***air*** ‘on’ (which itself has the complement *aon* ‘one’) – ***ainm air aon de na daoine seo*** ‘a name on (of) one of these men’. In the second, the common noun ***astar*** ‘distance’ is modified by the preposition ***tro*** ‘through’ – ***astar fada tro thìr fhàsail*** ‘a long distance through desolate land’.

In the third example, the nominative plural common noun ***gearrain*** ‘hares’ is modified by the preposition ***gu*** ‘to’ (which itself has the complement *leòr* ‘sufficiency’) – ***gearrain gu leòr*** ‘hares to sufficiency, enough hares’.

Prepositional pronouns can be modifiers of nouns all on their own.

> Thilg e urchair oirre, agus gheàrr sin na <mark title="The nominative plural common noun ‘sgiathan’ [wing] is modified by the prepositional pronoun ‘aice’ [at her] – ‘wings at her, her wings’.">sgiathan aice</mark>.

Here, the nominative plural common noun ***sgiathan*** ‘wings’ is modified by the prepositional pronoun ***aice*** ‘at her’ – ***sgiathan aice*** ‘wings at her, her wings’.

Also, the progressive particle ***ag*** counts as a preposition in this respect.

> Latha de na làithean chaidh e mach agus chunnaic e <mark title="The nominative feminine common noun ‘lach’ [duck] is modified by the particle ‘ag’ – ‘duck swimming on a lake’.">lach a’</mark> snàmh air loch.

In this examples, the nominative feminine common noun ***lach*** ‘duck’ is modified by the particle ***a’*** (which itself takes the verbal noun *snàmh* ‘swimming’ as its complement) – ***lach a’ snàmh*** ‘a duck swimming’.

It is not clear whether *proper nouns* can also be modified by prepositions, since there are no examples in the current text being analysed.

Notes:
  
- Strictly speaking, it is the preposition itself which is the grammatical modifier of the noun in these examples, and not the whole prepositional phrase. Grammatical relations, as we understand them, are between individual words and not between words and phrases.

#### Relative clause particles as modifiers of nouns

A noun can have a relative clause particle as a modifier.

*Common nouns* can be modified by the positive particle ***a*** ‘who(m), which, that’.

> Nuair a bha Fionn ’na leanabh beag, mharbhadh ’athair ann an aon de na <mark title="The dative plural common noun ‘blàraibh’ [battles] is modified by the relative particle ‘a’ [which] – ‘the battles which sent the Fianna among themselves’.">blàraibh a</mark> chuir an Fhiann ’nam measg fhéin.
> 
> Is i siud a’ chiad <mark title="The nominative feminine common noun ‘shealg’ [hunt] is modified by the relative particle ‘a’ [which] – ‘the first hunt which Finn did’.">shealg a</mark> rinn Fionn.

In the first example, the dative plural common noun ***blàraibh*** ‘battles’ is modified by the positive relative clause particle ***a*** ‘which, that’ (which itself has the verb *chuir* as complement) – ***blàraibh a chuir an Fhiann ’nam measg fhéin*** ‘battles which sent the Fianna among themselves’.

In the second example, The nominative feminine common noun ***shealg*** ‘hunt’ is also modified by ***a*** (which takes the verb ***rinn*** ‘did’ as its own complement) – ***shealg a rinn Fionn*** ‘hunt which Finn did’.

Common nouns can also be modified by prepositional relative clause particles.

> Nuair a bha an saoghal òg bha <mark title="The nominative plural common noun ‘daoine’ [men] is modfied by the prepositional relative particle ‘ris (an)’ [to whom] – ‘strong men to whom they would say the Fianna (ie. whom they would call the Fianna)’.">daoine</mark> treuna ann, <mark>ris</mark> an canadh iad an Fhiann</mark>.
>
> Dh’fhalbh i astar fada troimh thìr fhàsail gus an do lorg i an <mark title="The nominative masculine common noun ‘t-àite’ [place] is modified by the prepositional relative particle ‘anns an’ [in which] – ‘the place in which the infant was’." >t-àite anns</mark> an robh an leanabh.

In the first example here, the nominative plural common noun ***daoine*** ‘men’ is modified by the prepositional relative clause particle ***ris*** ‘against whom’ (which takes as complement the positive interrogative verb particle *an*, which itself takes as complement the verb *canadh* ‘would say’) – ***daoine ris an canadh iad an Fhiann*** ‘men against whom they would say the Fianna (ie. men whom they would call the Fianna)’.

In the second example, the nominative masculine common noun ***t-àite*** ‘place’ is modified by the prepositional relative clause particle ***anns*** ‘in which’ (which also takes as complement the positive interrogative verb particle *an*, which itself takes as complement the verb *robh* ‘was’) – ***àite anns an robh an leanabh*** ‘place in which the infant was’.

Common nouns can also be modified by the locative relative clause particle ***far***.

> Rachadh e a-mach don <mark title="The dative masculine common noun ‘achadh’ [field] is modified by the relative particle ‘far an’ [where] – ‘the place where plenty of hares were running from hill to hill’.">achadh far</mark> an robh gearrain gu leòr a’ ruith bho chnoc gu cnoc.

In this example, the dative masculine common noun ***achadh*** ‘a field’ is modified by the locative relative clause particle ***far*** ‘where’ (which takes as its complement the positive interrogative verb particle *an*, which itself takes the verb *robh* ‘was’ as its complement) – ***achadh far an robh gearrain a’ ruith*** ‘field where hares were running’.

It is not clear whether *proper nouns* can also be modified by relative clause particles, since there are no examples in the current text being analysed.
