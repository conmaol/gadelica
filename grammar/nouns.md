# Nouns

## Semantic characteristics of nouns

### Concrete and abstract nouns

Nouns are words that typically denote *material* entities.

Material entities are those individuals, substances, aggregates and groups which are literally *made of matter*, consisting of atoms, organised into molecules, crystals, and so on. 

Every word that denotes a material entity is a noun (or a [pronoun](pronouns.md)). 

However, not every noun denotes a material entity. Some nouns denote *non-material* entities, which are not made out of matter. Non-material entities include spaces (places and paths) and situations (states, processes, events and actions).

Nouns that denote material entities are known as **concrete** nouns, and nouns that denote non-material entities are known as **abstract** nouns. 

The following passage is adapted from Lachlann MacFhionghuin’s (c.1950) *Leabhraichean Leughaidh: Leabhar II* (p.81). All and only the nouns have been highlighted.

The concrete nouns in this passage are
***saoghal*** ‘a world’,
***daoine*** ‘men’,
***Fhiann*** ‘warriors’,
***Cumhall*** ‘Cumhall’,
***mac*** ‘a son’,
***Fionn*** ‘Finn’,
***leanabh*** (*leinibh*) ‘an infant’,
***athair*** (*athar*) ‘a father’,
***mhàthair*** ‘a mother’,
***naimhdean*** ‘enemies’,
***coilltean*** ‘forests’,
***dithis*** ‘a group of two people’, and
***bhan*** ‘women’.

The abstract nouns are 
***ainm*** ‘a name’,
***blàraibh*** ‘battles’,
***measg*** ‘midst’,
***eagal*** ‘fear’,
***tòir*** ‘a pursuit’, and
***chùram*** ‘care’.

  <summary>Notes</summary>

- Some readers might be uncomfortable seeing words like ***measg***, ***tòir*** and perhaps even ***chùram*** classified as (abstract) nouns in the above, preferring to think of them as parts of (complex) *prepositions* rather than words in and of themselves. This is a false binary – *measg*, *tòir* and *chùram* are **both** components of prepositional compounds **and** (perhaps fossilised) nouns.
  
- The (concrete) noun ***dithis*** ‘a group of two people’ is most accurately classified as a (concrete) noun with numeric meaning, rather than as a numeral *per se*.

### Proper nouns and common nouns

Nouns can be further classified according to the nature of their denotation, as in the way in which they relate to entities in the world –
- *proper nouns* are names of particular entities
- *common nouns* denote classes of entity

In the passage from the previous section, there are two proper nouns – ***Cumhal*** ‘Cumhall’ and ***Fionn*** ‘Finn’. 

All the other nouns in the passage, whether concrete or abstract, are common nouns – 
***saoghal*** ‘a world’,
***daoine*** ‘men’,
***Fhiann*** ‘warriors’,
***ainm*** ‘a name’,
***mac*** ‘a son’,
***leanabh*** (*leinibh*) ‘an infant’,
***athair*** (*athar*) ‘a father’,
***blàraibh*** ‘battles’,
***measg*** ‘midst’,
***eagal*** ‘fear’,
***mhàthair*** ‘a mother’,
***naimhdean*** ‘enemies’,
***tòir*** ‘a pursuit’,
***coilltean*** ‘forests’,
***chùram*** ‘care’.
***dithis*** ‘a group of two people’, and
***bhan*** ‘women’.

- Proper nouns are always capitalised in writing, even when they do not occur as the first word in a sentence. However, not all capitalised nouns in the middle of a sentence are proper nouns. For example, ***Fhiann*** ‘warriors’ in the passage above is correctly classified as a common noun. It is capitalised in the text because it is the core element (the ‘head’) of a phrase ***an Fhiann*** ‘the Warriors’ which is presented as being the name of a particular group of men (cf. ‘the Fenians’).

- the particular group of (groups of?) men. Moreover, even though ***An Fhiann*** is a name, it is *not* a proper noun, since it is not a noun. This important distinction between names and proper nouns has unfortunately not been properly grasped in previous descriptions of Gaelic grammar.
  
- The dimensions of concrete/abstract and proper/common are not truly orthogonal – all proper nouns are concrete; and hence all abstract nouns are common.

- Lamb (2024: 46): “Gaelic has two broad noun categories: common nouns and proper nouns. Common nouns are the physical and abstract entities that we discuss regularly in language, such as ‘bird’, ‘mountain’ or ‘philosophy’. Proper nouns are those items that we normally capitalise in writing, such as persons (‘Donald’) and places (‘Cape Breton’).”

(ii) Ainmear sònraichte, a tha na ainm air duine, air àite no air rudeigin àraidh, m.e. *Mòrag*; *Seumas*; *Glaschu*; *BBC ALBA*; *an Gearasdan*.
