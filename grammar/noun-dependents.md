### Appositives

Lamb (2024:37): “In Gaelic, most nouns can be preceded by a determiner, such as the definite article (‘the’), [...]. [...] As the head of a noun phrase, nouns maye be modified by adjectives, with which they share several properties. Adjectives modify a noun within a noun phrase or provide additional information about it, such as serving to restrict possible reference.”

Lamb (2024:38): “Determiners are added to a noun phrase to restrict or specify its reference. [...] Demonstratives [...] are used to mark a noun’s position or prominence. [...] [C]ardinal numerals [...] state the count of the nouns in discussion and ordinal numerals [...] state the position of the noun in a sequence [...]. [...] Prepositions indicate relationships between nouns, [...].”

> An uair a bha an saoghal òg bha daoine treuna ann, ris an canadh <ins>iad</ins> an Fhiann. B’ <ins>e</ins> Cumhal a b’ ainm air aon de na daoine so, agus bha mac aige air an robh Fionn.
> An uair a bha Fionn ’n a leanabh beag, mharbhadh athair ann an aon de na blàraibh a chuir an Fhiann ’nam measg fhéin. Bha eagal air a mhathair gun tigeadh naimhdean athar air tòir an leinibh, agus mar sin chuir <ins>i</ins> <ins>e</ins> a mach do na coilltean fàsail air chùram dithis mhnathan eòlach.
